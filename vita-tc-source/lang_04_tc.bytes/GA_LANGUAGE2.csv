"e65bfe50","I wonder if Luche is gonna be all right..."
"e95c0329","I know. She looked about ready to disappear."
"e85c01b6","I'm worried too, but let's let Mirei take care of her.
We've got our own stuff to handle right now."
"eb5c060f","Right. The master plan."
"ea5c049c","That's right—Project Reincarnation.
Taomon's brainchild."
"ed5c0955","Reincarnation... That's being reborn, right?
Wait, or was that resurrection?"
"ec5c07e2","Either would work, actually. You're pretty sharp, eh?"
"ef5c0cbb","This artist I like had a song called that on one of their
albums!"
"ee5c0ac8","Reincarnation, as the name suggests, is a codename for the
plan to bring about the rebirth of the Digital World."
"815920fa","This world was nearly overrun by the BH Program update.
As it stands now, recovery would be near impossible."
"8259226d","As such, better to return it to a state of pure data, purge
it, and let it be reborn anew. That's the idea, anyway."
"7f591d94","P-purge the world and let it be reborn?
Is that even possible?"
"80591f07","It wouldn't be easy, but with Omegamon Zwart D in our hands,
it'd be theoretically possible."
"7d591a4e","So, an AR plan? Those guys need Omegamon Zwart D for their
plan, too. What's AR supposed to mean?"
"7e591c21","Normally? ""Augmented Reality,"" I think. But in this case...
I can't figure out what they mean by it."
"7b591768","I believe they were saying it's a grand plan to tear down
all the gates that keep the parallel worlds apart."
"7c5918db","What would happen if you mashed the real world and Digital
World together like that?"
"79591402","Couldn't say. But you can be sure it'd cause a real panic in
both of them."
"7a5915f5","At worst, two merging dissonant worlds could interfere with
one another so much as to lead both to ruin."
"7b56d8f1","As in, the world would end?!"
"7a56d71e","We won't let it. We're gonna smash Tsuzuki and the others,
and take Omegamon Zwart D back."
"7956d5ab","That'll stop the AR Plan, plus make Reincarnation possible."
"7856d438","Hear, hear!"
"7f56df3d","How are you not terrified of them, Kouta?"
"7e56dd4a","I am, but how else are we supposed save the world?
Scared or not, we've got no choice."
"7d56dbd7","I don't know how much we can do, but let's do what we can!
Right, Yukimura?"
"7c56da64","Right!"
"7356cc19","I can see how fired up you are, Kouta!"
"7256caa6","Yukimura... All right, let's go!
Suddenly I feel like maybe we can actually do this!"
"75549088","Looks like we've got no time to be scared either, Rikka.
Time to roll up our sleeves and get going!"
"7654927b","I don't think your sleeves are even long enough to roll up,
Himari."
"775493ee","Then I'm already good!"
"78549541","Not to rain on the parade, but how exactly are we supposed
to get Omegamon Zwart D back?"
"79549734","Oh, right... They've got that power like Mirei's where they
can just come and go through space."
"7a5498a7","So not only do we not know where they went, even if we did,
we couldn't really chase them down."
"7b549a1a","Well, then we'd better let Mirei in on the plan first.
She ought to turn up here once she's analyzed Luche."
"7c549b8d","Meanwhile, there's something I must ask of all of you."
"6d548410","The other core of Project Reincarnation is the town of
Floatia. Keep developing it until the plan is ready to go."
"6e548583","Which means, time to gather more residents!"
"7f65e9a7","Roger! Leave it to me!"
"7e65e834","Heh heh! Guess there's a sunrise at the end of every night.
You're one reliable bunch."
"8165ec8d","We'll let you know when we hear from Mirei. {0},
you help gather residents too for now."
"3025437d","Luche!"
"2d253ea4","You okay? Nothing too painful happened?"
"2e254017","Yeah..."
"2b253b5e","What did the analysis reveal, then?"
"2c253d31","Some fascinating things, indeed. The one that caught me by
surprise at first was...the makeup of Luche's body."
"29253878","It highly resembles that of a Digimon. They have a
similarity of—ready for this?—98.1%."
"2a2539eb","That's enough to say that, essentially, Luche is a Digimon.
Or as good as one, anyway."
"27253512","The humans of this world are pure digital data, so they
don't feel fatigue or hunger...but how about Luche?"
"28253685","Actually, I'm pretty sure she talked about being hungry back
when we first met."
"952820d3","And she said she was worn out when we escaped from Omegamon
Zwart D in the Server Tower, too."
"94281f60","So I'm...not human?
I'm...not like {0}?"
"97282439","Luche..."
"96282246","Next, and this will be difficult for you too, Luche, but...
that stuffed animal you were holding?"
"9928271f","I discovered traces of a network signal and some data
transmissions coming from inside it."
"982825ac","I've confirmed that most of what we've spoken about aloud
was transmitted over the network to...somewhere."
"9b282a65","Last, and most momentous and serious of all:"
"9a2828f2","Luche...was a carrier for the BH Program."
"9d282d4b","Good heavens! Are you sure?"
"9c282bd8","Positive. There was a program you might call the root virus
very cleverly concealed inside the animal."
"2320b198","Hmph. So we looked over Luche herself, but the stuffed
animal was the blind spot."
"2420b30b","Hang on. So is this thing still carrying the BH Program?
And if so, why is it anywhere near us?"
"2520b4fe","Don't worry, I ran antivirus software and purged it."
"2620b651","Phew, good. But what was the BH Program doing hidden in
Luche's plush toy in the first place?"
"2720b7c4","That's the problem. Luche is an asymptomatic carrier, so
considering that she lost her memories—"
"2820b9b7","It's highly likely that she was being used."
"2920bb2a","Yes. Which makes the one using her—"
"2a20bc9d","Shoma Tsuzuki!"
"1b20a520","Did interrupting suddenly become all the rage here?"
"1c20a693","I b-betrayed everyone... I got you sick!
Does that make me...bad?"
"2922f981","It's not your fault, Luche!
Don't worry about it."
"2822f82e","{0}'s right.
You couldn't have known, Luche."
"2722f6bb","That's right! Don't beat yourself up, Luche.
No one blames you for a thing."
"2622f4c8","..."
"2d22ffcd","I understand the temptation to blame yourself, Luche.
But regret won't change anything."
"2c22fe5a","You know what will? Getting some payback on the one who put
you through all this."
"2b22fce7","Pay...back?"
"2a22fb74","Yes. We'll thwart Shoma Tsuzuki's schemes, and right the
wrongs he inflicted on you and this world."
"2122ed29","I like the idea, but the problem is that Tsuzuki is behind
all of this, and we don't know where he is."
"2022ebb6","Oh, no need to worry about that.
Luche can tell us where he is."
"a72ef8ce","Huh? I don't know that!"
"a82efaa1","Your stuffed animal was transmitting data to wherever Shoma
Tsuzuki is."
"a52ef5e8","If we follow that trace and pinpoint his network
coordinates, we can pin him down."
"a62ef75b","Once we have his coordinates, Taomon and I can use our skill
to open a gate right to him."
"ab2eff7a","So we'll turn the enemy's tricks against them. A fine idea!"
"ac2f00ed","So I'm...useful?"
"a92efc14","Useful? You're indispensable!
None of this would even work without you."
"aa2efd87","So I c-can stay here with {0}?"
"9f2eec56","Good! Then I'll totally do my best!"
"a02eedc9","That's the spirit, Luche!"
"2d320ab7","Then Project Reincarnation is up to Taomon and Datamon, while
Jijimon, Mameo and I pinpoint the signal coordinates."
"2c3208c4","Roger that!"
"2f320d9d","So back to recruiting the residents for us, huh?"
"2e320c2a","Looks like it. Might as well start now! C'mon, Kouta and
{0}, let's go!"
"3879b09e","All right, this is everyone."
"3779af2b","Well then, let's dive right in and hear how everyone's work
has turned out."
"3679adb8","Thanks to {0} and the others' hard work,
Floatia is now capable of launching Project Reincarnation."
"3d79b8bd","The town is now effectively a massive computer processor.
If we insert Omegamon Zwart D here as the core,"
"3c79b6ca","his purification power, combined with the antivirus, should
bring about a total data purge."
"3b79b557","You're gonna turn the town into a purification device?"
"3a79b3e4","Indeed. We will load the entire Digital World into the town,
and after the purge, revive it as reborn data."
"3179a599","This is, in essence, reincarnation."
"3079a426","Where are you going to store all that data?"
"33776a08","You can't just store a copy of all of the Digital World
inside the Digital World itself, can you?"
"34776bfb","You're right. We'll need to resolve all network gaps and
migrate the data somewhere else for a time."
"35776d6e","And this is one colossal heap of data, so we'll need to move
it, purge it, and swap it back chunk by chunk."
"36776ec1","But then won't the reborn data get infected by the BH
Program as soon as we restore it?"
"377770b4","There are grounds for concern, but we have no other option."
"38777227","Wait. There may be one other way."
"3977739a","What do you mean?"
"3a77750d","We've nearly pinpointed the address that Luche's toy was
transmitting to. Shoma Tsuzuki's location."
"2b775d90","Where is it? Somewhere in the Digital World?"
"2c775f03","No. It's in a place called the Singular Zone."
"a57ed943","Wha'—the Singular Zone?! Impossible!"
"a47ed7d0","The Singular Zone is where the Digital World's deleted data
ends up. Not unlike what the human world calls the ""beyond""!"
"a77edca9","The idea that it exists at all, let alone that a human could
set foot there, is pure fantasy!"
"a67edb36","I was skeptical, too. But facts are facts."
"a97edf8f","We found a vast, basically infinite blank space in the area
that was picking up Luche's signal."
"a87ede1c","In there, we observed multitudes of formless blocks of data,
plus the data of a number of Digimon...and one human."
"ab7ee2d5","Hmm. An infinite blank space, you say. If that's true, the
AR Plan may be closer to realization than we thought. But..."
"aa7ee162","An infinite space? Sounds like somewhere we could actually
move the data of Digital World to."
"ad7ee63b","Exactly. No need to move it piece by piece—we could migrate
all the data there together, at once."
"ac7ee448","What about a way to access the Singular Zone?
Have you found one?"
"3f7bfa7a","Once Taomon finds his head, he can open the way."
"407bfbed","Hmph. My head is where it always is. I am perfectly calm."
"3d7bf714","Clearly. So there should be no problem."
"3e7bf887","We did it, Luche! This is a big feat!"
"3b7bf3ce","Really? I have big feet?"
"3c7bf5a1","Yup, a big feat.
Yup, big feet.
I wouldn't say that..."
"397bf0e8","Hee hee, {0} complimented me!"
"3a7bf25b","I do not have big feet! They're normal size!"
"377bed82","You said it yourself..."
"387bef75","Aww... I guess I'm no good after all."
"b18369b5","Come on, just say it's a big feat next time!"
"b08367c2","Anyway, things sure are looking brighter for us.
Just have to set the plan in motion now!"
"af83666f","Kouta and I can go to the Server Tower and retrieve the
Digital World's backup data."
"ae8364fc","They say that everything since the inception of the Digital
World is recorded and stored there."
"ad836309","There might be some important data left there that we'd need
to have reincarnated."
"ac836196","Way to casually drop a critical mission on us!"
"ab836023","Taomon, Luche and I will go beneath the town and open the
gate to the Singular Zone."
"aa835eb0","What should I do?"
"b983762d","You're in charge of defending the town, Himari.
Who knows when the enemy might stop by?"
"b88374ba","Okay, you got it!"
"ab81214c","{0}, we want you on the front line!"
"ac81233f","You'll enter the Singular Zone, thwart Tsuzuki's plans, get
Omegamon Zwart D back..."
"ad812492","and save all our worlds!"
"ca70604b","There you are, {0}.
Let us begin."
"cb70623e","It's open!"
"cc706391","It confounds me still that the Singular Zone could be just
beyond here."
"cd706504","Well, prepare to be un-confounded.
Now, {0}, if you please."
"ce7066f7","No getting lost! You better come back!"
"84982eb4","—ear me? Can you hear me, {0}?"
"8798330d","Ah, thank goodness. Looks like we can still send and receive
signals from within the Singular Zone."
"8698319a","I don't know what's past here, so who knows how much help
it'll be, but..."
"819829fb","I'll analyze the data from your Digivice in real time and
follow you as best I can!"
"80982808","I can't tell you not to worry, but you're not alone.
Do your best. The world is in your hands!"
"ae614121","So you've actually made it this far."
"ab613c68","You've bandaged up your broken heart with bravery—or is
it idiocy?—and now you stand before me again. Bravo."
"ac613ddb","In recognition of your courage, I will grant you the honor
of becoming a stain on Kikurin, my sword."
"b16145fa","Hold, Samudramon. The AR Plan is in its final stage.
We have no time to waste on trifles like this."
"b261476d","What? It'll be done in an instant. The plan will be fine."
"af614294","No. Master Shoma's plan is absolute.
It has no room for the interference of your ego."
"b0614407","Ego has nothing to do with it.
For me, doing battle with strong opponents is everything."
"a56132d6","There's the problem. The battle you seek—it should be with
the ultimate opponent, the one central to the AR Plan."
"a6613449","We can't leave anything about the plan up to chance."
"33645137","Ugh. Then what do we do with this one?"
"32644f44","Measures are being taken."
"3564541d","Tch. We're prepared enough."
"346452aa","And well we ought to be."
"2f644a8b","You've a long way to go to stop us, {0}.
But don't worry. I will deliver your requiem."
"2e644918","This is bad..."
"31644dd1","Like we'll let you!"
"30644c7e","Sorry to take so long, {0}!"
"2b64445f","You made it in time!"
"2a6442ec","{0}, leave this to—"
"a15caf5c","Wait! Me too! I wanna say it!"
"a25cb0cf","This is really not the time...but whatever.
Fine, all together! One, two, three!"
"a35cb2a2","We've got this! Get going already!"
"13392663","We've got this! You go on ahead!"
"542b16e2","I've been waiting for you, {0}!
No need for words—you know what comes next!"
"532b150f","Light my blood aflame!
Lead my body in a dance!"
"522b139c","Now, join me in this frenzy of death!"
"ce75b7af","My...my strength was not enough...
That was...remarkable, {0}."
"cf75b902","There is...nothing stopping you anymore.
Go on, see the new world for yourself."
"d075baf5","New world? We can't let that happen!"
"c975aff0","You're...too late. You can no longer stop it...
No one can."
"ca75b163","I only regret...that I cannot witness...the birth of this
new world...with my own eyes...but I've still won."
"cb75b2d6","..."
"cc75b449","Let's go, {0}.
We've got to stop the AR Plan, no matter what."
"3df85d8","So you've come, {0}. I suppose they weren't
enough to stop you after all."
"6df8a91","But that's fine.
I've been thinking perhaps I could show this to you."
"5df893e","?"
"8df8df7","{0}! Are you all right?!"
"7df8c04","Hah, so you've made it too.
Although all your partners seem badly wounded..."
"adf90dd","Bah. You saw right through us."
"9df8f6a","Oh well, I'll just have to show you all my discovery. Beyond
altered form—Ultimate Altered Digivolution!"
"fcdf7ad3","GA—AA—OOOOOHHNNNNNN!!"
"fbdf7960","Heh heh. This is Omegamon Alter-B."
"7edc75c2","My new partner, the lord of this new creation, who will
smash open all the gates between the parallel worlds!"
"7fdc77b5","It can't be... He made the Enforcer Digivolve?"
"7cdc72fc","It was your partner who gave me the idea, Kouta Hirose."
"7ddc746f","Seeing an altered form that wasn't Machinedramon was a big
clue about Ultimate Altered Digivolution!"
"7adc6f96","You...did you see Yukimura turn into SkullGreymon?"
"7bdc7109","I learned that by breaking their minds, I could produce
altered forms of Digimon other than Machinedramon..."
"78dc6cb0","And then...I experimented with different methods of
breaking them, to see what they became."
"79dc6e23","And following the conclusions I drew from my data...
I broke Omegamon Zwart D."
"86dc82ba","What in the world...?"
"87dc842d","Hee hee. You've all led me to such interesting discoveries!"
"78da2dd9","And, thanks to all of them, the AR Plan—the Advanced Realm
Plan—will finally come to fruition here."
"77da2c66","What are you thinking?!
What're you trying to do by bringing the worlds together?"
"76da2af3","Heh...heh heh! Nothing, really.
I just want to see..."
"75da2900","See what?!"
"7cda3405","The quaking of the fools who crushed my dreams before, as
they face the despair of death!"
"7bda3292","T-Tsuzuki, you're..."
"7ada313f","You're out of your mind!"
"79da2f4c","Breaking open the gates between the parallel worlds...
Is that even possible?"
"80da3ab1","Even if you make the Enforcer Digivolve, you shouldn't be
able to get your hands on that kind of energy..."
"7fda38de","I can! That's the point of the BH Program—to make all
Digimon, and the Digital World itself, into altered forms!"
"72d7e5d0","I'll convert it all into energy and feed it to Omegamon
Alter-B!"
"73d7e743","All throughout the Digital World, even Digimon in training
will be altered to their ultimate forms!"
"74d7e936","The energy that comes from it will be enough to rival the
Big Bang, the light of creation itself!"
"75d7eaa9","Bwahahaha! Now...Omegamon Alter-B!"
"76d7ec1c","Devour the Digital World, and blow off the gates keeping the
parallel worlds apart!"
"77d7ed8f","UOOOOOOOOOHH!!!"
"78d7ef62","The energy's gathering!"
"79d7f0d5","Is the Digital World changing to its altered form?!"
"7ad7f248","{0}! Please!!!
Stop Omegamon Alter-B!"
"7bd7f43b","If he gathers all that energy, all the worlds will be
destroyed!"
"7ce93e8f","Bwahahaha! As if anyone alive could stop the supreme
Omegamon Alter-B!!!"
"800f4545","That's...impossible!!!
No! There's no way! This! Cannot! Be! HAPPENING!!!"
"7d0f408c","Everyone! Are you all right?"
"7e0f427f","You're too late, Mr. Mameo! It's already over!"
"7b0f3da6","I'm sorry. I left as soon as I sensed a strange event in the
Digital World, but..."
"7c0f3f19","You! That brat...from before?!
The stupid little brat who crushed my ambitions?!"
"790f3a40","...Tsuzuki?"
"7a0f3c33","Unnnngh! Not again! NOT AGAIN!!!"
"870f504a","Ah...vanishing! No...not like this! Help... Help m—
uuh—uuuOOOOOOAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!"
"880f523d","Hyah! What was that?"
"85118bdb","Could it be...is he...?"
"84118a68","GUH—GAAAH—AAAAAAAaaaaahhhh..."
"87118f21","{0}! Use the antivirus program!
Just bring them back to Floatia like this!"
"86118d4e","The Enforcer's turned into Omegamon Alter-B now...
Is Reincarnation still possible?"
"89119207","I don't know, but we've got to try."
"88119094","We stopped the AR Plan, but the Digital World is still in
crisis."
"8b11956d","Reincarnation is ready to launch.
Let's hurry back to town."
"8a1193fa","{0}, can you get the Enforcer?
I'll bring...this one."
"e76e133b","Look! Tsuzuki!"
"e86e14ae","Ugh... Where am I?"
"e96e1601","Tsuzuki. You're awake."
"ea6e17f4","...Mr. Mameo?"
"eb6e1967","Huh? What are YOU doing calling him that?"
"ec6e1ada","He's... He's my homeroom teacher."
"ed6e1c4d","What? No, wait... What?!
Mr. Mameo's a real teacher?"
"de6e04d0","Well, I do teach Japanese at his school."
"df6e0643","Mameo taught the bad guy?!"
"ec7059b1","Oh geez, I've been impolite this whole time...
Buuuut he's not at my school, so I should be fine, right?"
"eb7057de","You may want to be more polite around your elders,
regardless of whether they're your teacher or not."
"ea70566b","Yes, I suppose I'd better!"
"e97054f8","Enough wasting time.
We need to begin the Reincarnation."
"f0705ffd","That's right! Reincarnation starts now!"
"ef705e0a","What... What's starting?"
"ee705c97","We're using this whole town to purify and renew the Digital
World by taking it apart and putting it back together again."
"ed705b24","Taking it apart, putting it back together...
and making it anew?"
"e4704cd9","It's our plan to wipe out the BH Program you were spreading!"
"e3704b66","Will that be effective on anything and everything that's
made of digital data?"
"f272a1ba","This is just to clean up the BH Program, so it only targets
things that were infected, but..."
"f372a32d","I suppose if we tried, we could use it on every single thing
in this world, too."
"f0729e54","Then...would you do this for me? Would you...dissemble me?
I don't need to be reassembled."
"f1729fc7","So you're asking us to delete you from this world
altogether?"
"ee729b0e","I've done so many terrible things...
I deserve this punishment."
"ef729ce1","It's good you're remorseful, but...this is scary."
"ec729828","I think the weight of his crimes hit him when he was freed
from the curse."
"ed72999b","Curse?"
"ea7294c2","The lingering hatred of a man I've defeated. After the final
battle in the Singular Zone, I saw him leave Tsuzuki's body."
"eb7296b5","This boy is the victim of that curse, you say?"
"58758083","No... I sought out the Singular Zone myself, felt the curse,
and gave my body up to it. It was all me."
"57757f10","Everything is my fault. Luche. I've done such awful things
to you. Surely you despise me."
"5a7583e9","I wanna smack you! But I won't!"
"59758276","Huh?"
"5c7586cf","When I looked at Shoma, I remembered something."
"5b75855c","Your memories came back?!"
"5e758a15","Yeah. I...used to be a Digimon. I had a kind partner, and I
was the happiest Digimon ever!"
"5d7588a2","But then, something went ""pop"" and then, for a long long
time, I was in a dark place."
"60758d7b","I was all alone... I was cold, and lonely, and real scared."
"5f758b88","And I cried and cried, until I heard a voice.
Shoma's voice."
"5e77c88c","I tried real hard to follow the voice, and then...
I found him."
"5f77ca7f","So you met Tsuzuki in the Singular Zone."
"6077cbd2","The tales of Digimon who lose their partners ending up in
the Singular Zone were true..."
"6177cd45","But the Singular Zone's huge. To be called by a human who
accessed it by chance and actually meet 'em? Miraculous!"
"5a77c240","That was no miracle. It might even have been inevitable."
"5b77c433","How do you mean?"
"5c77c5a6","Tamers and partners are drawn together."
"5d77c719","Just as {0} and {0}'s partners were,
and Kouta and Himari and their partners were..."
"6677d564","No matter how much time passes, the ties between them
continue to bind. They can never be severed."
"6777d6d7","Wait! You're saying Luche and Tsuzuki were that way, too?"
"647a10f5","But if they were, then how could he do something so awful to
Luche?"
"637a0f02","Could Tsuzuki have been unaware that Luche used to be his
partner?"
"627a0daf","I had no idea."
"617a0c3c","Actually, why would you discard your partner like that in
the first place?"
"607a0a49","Back in that tournament, I...lost to {0}."
"5f7a08d6","Tournament? You mean back in fifth grade? Didn't you beat
out {0} to win that time?"
"5e7a0763","No, I lost. I saw Hirose and {0} in the
semifinals, and I realized I couldn't win."
"5d7a05f0","So I...I cheated. I modded my partner's data."
"6c7a1d6d","!!!"
"6b7a1bfa","I did win the battle, but I'd lost before it began, really.
I came out on top, but with an awful feeling in my chest."
"ea7d227e","I meant to do it over. Once my partner revived, I'd win fair
and square, I thought. But..."
"eb7d23d1","My partner never revived.
I think... I think it was because I modded the data."
"e87d1f18","I discarded my partner and started raising a new DigiEgg.
I wanted the ultimate Digimon. I gathered all kinds of info."
"e97d208b","Anything the network could tell me, I wanted to learn.
But in the process...I first heard of the Digital Dive."
"ee7d28aa","I became obsessed. I dove again and again.
The more I did it, the bigger the world became!"
"ef7d2a1d","And then, one day just before summer vacation...
I discovered the Singular Zone."
"ec7d2544","Right around when you stopped coming to school."
"ed7d2737","The Singular Zone was...full of the unknown. Ruins of
Digimon I'd never seen, huge clouds of mysterious data..."
"e27d1586","In them I found data fragments glowing with an odd light.
In the light, I saw the potential for an ultimate Digimon..."
"e37d1779","I suppose that must have been the curse."
"f07f6a67","It's clear to me now how foolish I was, but...in the moment
I was overjoyed, and I reached out to touch the light."
"ef7f68f4","From that moment, madness lived within me.
And the rest...well, the rest you all know."
"f27f6d4d","I made the BH Program based on the curse, made the network
gaps, destroyed the meddling Enforcer, formed the AR plan..."
"f17f6bda","I remade Luche using the ruined data I found in the Singular
Zone...and I used her."
"ec7f643b","These are all my crimes. My unforgiveable crimes."
"eb7f6248","But Shoma, I met {0} thanks to you!"
"ee7f6701","There was plenty of bad stuff, but...I was happy I got to
meet {0} and everyone!"
"ed7f65ae","So I'll let you off with no smacks this time!"
"e87f5d8f","Luche... But I—"
"e77f5c1c","Oh, shut it already! Luche says she forgives you! Say sorry
and thank you first before you go all wishy-washy!"
"d65a70a0","Yes! I'm... I'm sorry.
And thank you."
"d75a7213","Well, Luche had it worst of all from you, so if she's
willing to forgive, I guess I can't be mad anymore, either."
"d85a7386","What about you, {0}?"
"d95a7579","Let's forgive him.
No way!"
"da5a76ec","It's okay with you? Really?"
"db5a785f","Come on, {0}, don't say that."
"dc5a7a32","Time for me to take responsibility as homeroom teacher.
I know I may seem unreliable, but leave him to me."
"dd5a7ba5","Mr. Mameo..."
"de5a7d18","What'll we do, Taomon?"
"df5a7e8b","I don't like it, but I suppose it's part of the flow of
life. In which case, all we can do is drift along."
"dc5cb8a9","There you have it, Shoma Tsuzuki."
"db5cb736","Though of course, we don't speak for the whole Digital
World, you know."
"da5cb543","I imagine a good number of folks won't be forgiving.
Think very carefully about how you'll handle that."
"d95cb3d0","I will."
"e05cbed5","So...everything's finally settled?"
"df5cbd62","Seems so. I can confirm that the network is recovering from
its outages."
"de5cbb8f","It's a gamble whether things will work out with Omegamon
Alter-B, but...at least the Reincarnation's a success."
"dd5cba1c","That said, it'll take a good long time before the Digital
World is completely reborn."
"e45cc501","Meaning we won't be able to see it through ourselves?"
"e35cc3ae","Think so. Honestly, I'm ready to get back to the real world
as soon as I possibly can."
"464279f3","So...it's goodbye?"
"45427800","Once the Reincarnation Project is complete, you'll be able
summon {0} and the rest again, you know."
"48427cd9","Tsuzuki and I can come along on Digital Dives, too."
"47427b66","So...I'll see you again?"
"4a42803f","You bet!
I'm definitely coming back here...once things calm down."
"49427e4c","Well, why don't we make it official?
Let's promise that we'll meet in the Digital World again."
"4c428305","Yeah! Here, gimme your pinky."
"4b428192","Hey, what're you doing? Get over here already."
"4e42866b","B-but..."
"4d4284f8","Just join in. I have a feeling there's a lot you can learn
from this bunch."
"6040642a","Seriously? Learn? From Kouta?"
"6140659d","Sure! I can teach you...um...
how to make your friends laugh, or something!"
"5e4060c4","Ha ha! Sure you can."
"5f4062b7","Yes. Please, teach me that."
"5c405dfe","Wait, he's actually really serious."
"5d405f51","Here goes! We promise that when the Digital World is reborn,
we'll all meet here again!"
"5a405a98","Looks like things are wrapping up. Shall we go?"
"5b405c0b","Thank you, {0}, I mean it! You too, Himari and
Kouta! When you get back, we're having a real feast!"
"584057b2","You have my deep gratitude as well. You've helped us in a
real and true way."
"59405925","All right already!"
"da3d52a1","Um, why are you taking the compliments?
I'm pretty sure {0} worked the hardest."
"d93d50ce","C'mon, lets not be so tough on each other."
"d83d4f5b","Yukimura! I'll be back!"
"d73d4de8","Right!"
"de3d58ed","Rikka, wait for me just a little while, okay?"
"dd3d577a","All right, I'm looking forward to the day I see you again!"
"dc3d5587","You... You've gotta come back sometime, {0}."
"db3d5414","Thanks for everything!
And hey—I can't wait to see you again!"
"af30c24d","Thanks so much for everything!
I can't wait to see you again!"
"3ee16b4e","...up... Wake up, {0}..."
"3de169db","It's time to keep your promise. Now, equip your Digivice!"
"34f5c504","No matter the task, you need to gather residents.
Can't get anything done without helping hands. Shake a leg!"
"e782c649","We'll let you know the moment there's a word from Mirei.
Please handle gathering residents."
"f1e84839","How many Digimon have we already called here?
I feel like it was a lot, but I guess we're not done yet..."
"3e6ba5a9","The bigger our crew, the more we can build, and the easier
the adventure gets!"
"5df83b9d","Better recruit as hard as we can!"
"fac525a2","Let's not slack on the pep talks OR the prep work!"
"7febe9f2","All right, time for the finale.
You've already done so much, but you're not quite done yet!"
"7a07f5","We still need more residents!
Keep going, take us on to the finale!"
"a4b24b34","We've got no more regrets to worry about.
All we need to do now is to gather more residents."
"6afb2bbc","I admit I'm surprised, but it's a good thing Luche is okay!"
"996dba80","We still need to gather more residents."
"4aec4bd8","How the hell could he do this to Luche?
Tsuzuki Shoma..."
"c9f26d3b","It's unforgivable!
Now we have to show him what justice looks like!"
"8d950308","I'm different from {0}...
What a bummer..."
"d1f590bb","We know who the culprit is. Now we just need to settle this."
"c6c13cd3","What an interesting reality. Behavior almost like a human's,
and yet..."
"2d180abe","This world hangs in the balance, so it's up to you once
again!"
"5afea44b","Leave the town to us, {0}, and go kick
some butt!"
"c0902583","Himari and I will defend the town with all we've got.
The front line is up to you!"
"4beecadb","Don't be a lone wolf—I've got Mr. Mameo here, so don't worry
about me!"
"872211ac","I've been feeling power overflowing from within my heart!
Leave Kouta to us!"
"8f25352c","We'll take care of Kouta over here, so keep it together over
there!"
"f25aba67","This world hangs in the balance, so it's up to you once
again!"
"a4fbba26","I still can't believe this, but we've no way out but
forward. I'm counting on you, {0}."
"1bf5109e","Leave the town to us, {0}, and go kick
some butt!"
"4c011b22","Himari and I will defend the town with all we've got.
The front line is up to you!"
"e0f8dade","Don't be a lone wolf—I've got Mr. Mameo here, so don't worry
about me!"
"3deac55","I've been feeling power overflowing from within my heart!
Leave Kouta to us!"
"e01d110a","You come back now so I don't get lonely!
Please, {0}!"
"f69b3d","We'll take care of Kouta over here, so keep it together over
there!"
"be1cfd5","I'm sure if anyone can do it, you can, but be careful.
I'll be your guide."
"ce0f69d0","This world hangs in the balance, so it's up to you once
again!"
"6aab870d","I see, so the inside is a block data topography..."
"8a4f41fd","Leave the town to us, {0}, and go kick
some butt!"
"51102075","Himari and I will defend the town with all we've got.
The front line is up to you!"
"bebe6c31","Don't be a lone wolf—I've got Mr. Mameo here, so don't worry
about me!"
"4d056d66","I've been feeling power overflowing from within my heart!
Leave Kouta to us!"
"d8f07aed","You come back now so I don't get lonely!
Please, {0}!"
"3b384e96","We'll take care of Kouta over here, so keep it together over
there!"
"73efe23e","We've still got a good way to go.
I know you can do this. I'm counting on you!"
"ca9206a1","Samudramon and Kuzuhamon!
They're some tough opponents...so prepare carefully."
"fb727e68","Kuzuhamon?!
...I see. So that's what they're doing."
"96679e70","Leave this part here to us.
You go on and deal with what's up ahead!"
"f682c6dc","Leave this to us. Go on and finish things!"
"62a9fd3c","I know I can be flaky, but I'll prop things up here somehow!
Go on ahead!"
"d9bea80f","Keep going! We'll take care of things here!"
"94f39984","Himari and Kouta both got to go...
Ugh! I wanna be useful!"
"d8203f77","Looks like the confidant has taken the stage.
I don't think you should take that power lightly. Take care!"
"6fe2185a","All that's left is the last room. There's nothing left to
say. We're counting on you, {0}."
"ff67857","So it was Kuzuhamon.
I imagine everything will be decided in that last room."
"7fef9bff","Well, we beat them somehow, but...I can't do any more."
"f349a0f","I'm sorry... I think I used up my powers."
"2dc1e9ef","Ungh! Still...still...
I can't move. I'm sorry, {0}."
"39d2b600","Even if I went now, I'd just slow you down.
I'm sorry, {0}, it's up to you."
"16aa35d7","All right, time to charge into the last room!
Agh, I wanna go toooo!"
"3b617988","All right. Let's go finish this."
