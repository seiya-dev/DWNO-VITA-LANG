"1bd2b53d","This bed is awesome, puni!"
"1bd2b53c","I love this big house, puni!"
"1bd2b53f","But enough of that... What did you want to talk about, puni?
I can tell you all you need to know about battles, puni!"
"1ad2b34b","Now then, let's talk about battle basics, puni!"
"1ad2b348","When a battle starts, your partner Digimon will think for
themselves and fight to defeat the enemy, puni."
"1ad2b349","What's more, Tamers can help bring them to victory by giving
orders, puni."
"1ad2b34e","There are all sorts of things you can do, like setting
Special Moves, Agitated enhancements, and Skills, puni!"
"1ad2b34f","Just remember, you need Order Points (OP) to issue orders.
You can't just use them willy-nilly, puni!"
"1ad2b34c","Use them at the wrong time can result in needless waste or
missed opportunities, so be careful, puni..."
"1ad2b34d","You can also throw in items you've brought along to restore
or support your partners, puni. Use them well, puni!"
"1ad2b342","If you want to know more about this, ask anytime, puni.
I'll be happy to teach you, puni!"
"19d2b1d6","I'll teach you about Order Rings, puni. They're both basic
and important, puni!"
"19d2b1d5","To give Orders to your partner Digimon, first open the Order
Ring, puni."
"19d2b1d4","Press <icon>L</icon> to open Partner L's Order Ring, or <icon>R</icon>
to open Partner R's Order Ring, puni."
"19d2b1d3","It stays open while the button is pressed, but it'll close
by itself after a while, puni."
"19d2b1d2","With it open, move the cursor with <icon>LS</icon> and select the
Order you want with <icon>○</icon> to make it happen, puni!"
"19d2b1d1","I also hear you can learn more Tamer Skills to give more
types of Orders, puni."
"18d2b065","Now I'll tell you all about Attack Orders, puni!"
"18d2b066","The good part of Attack Orders is not just being able to use
them whenever you want, puni."
"18d2b067","They pack a bit more punch than what your partners do by
themselves, and they don't use MP, puni!"
"18d2b060","Still, there are times when you can't use them right away,
like if you're in the middle of doing something else, puni."
"18d2b061","If you can't use one at all, you'll get a ""no good"" message
when you try, puni. Others will execute late, puni."
"17d2aef0","Next it's OP and Support, puni!"
"17d2aef3","Issuing Orders uses Order Points (OP), puni. So how do you
increase your OP, puni?"
"17d2aef2","Your OP at the start of battle is equal to your Bond, puni."
"17d2aef5","Increasing your Bond lets you do more stuff right off the
bat, so always try and increase your Bond, puni!"
"17d2aef4","You can raise your OP during battle by using Support, puni."
"17d2aef7","Use Support with the <icon>○</icon> button, puni. This is
especially effective when pressed during attacks and defeat."
"17d2aef6","But it can't be used in rapid succession, puni. After using
Support, you'll have to wait a little to use it again."
"17d2aef9","Finally, OP gained using Support does not carry over to the
next battle. Your OP will revert to your Bond value, puni."
"17d2aef8","Taking on several battles in a short time period will add a
bit of bonus OP to the initial amount based on Bond, puni."
"16d2ad1e","Ten consecutive battles will raise your OP by 50, I hear.
Combine this with your Bond to fire off Special Moves, puni!"
"16d2ad1f","Now I'll tell you all about ExE. Extra Cross Evolution,
puni!"
"16d2ad1c","You'll have to meet some pretty strict conditions to use
Extra Cross Evolution, puni."
"16d2ad1d","First, your partner pairing, puni. One's got to be Mega and
higher, and the other needs to be Champion or higher, puni."
"16d2ad1a","Not only that, both of their Bonds and DigiFriends have to
be maxed out, puni."
"16d2ad1b","In this state, you can unleash an ExE instead of a Special
Move, puni."
"16d2ad18","But remember, you can only use this once per day, puni. What
did you expect, for something so crazy powerful, puni?!"
"16d2ad19","使用E x E使兩隻夥伴的力量合而為一，
這種超強力的狀態可以一直維持到戰鬥結束噗尼！"
"16d2ad16","如果數碼友情不高，或者其中一方是成熟期或完全體的話，
能力會稍微減弱，但即使如此也依然很厲害噗尼"
"16d2ad17","還有因為威力太強大了，所以有「一天只能使用一次」
這樣的限制，用的時候要留意哦噗尼"
"15d2abab","另外…　除了下達Order，聽說還有其他情況下
也能使出E x E呢…　一定是遇到危機時吧噗尼！？"
"15d2abaa","I'll tell you all about losing a battle, puni..."
"15d2aba9","When a Digimon's HP is reduced to zero it'll collapse, puni."
"15d2aba8","If both of your partner Digimon collapse, you'll lose the
battle and be sent back to the city, puni."
"15d2abaf","If one partner is still active, quick use of a Regen Disc
on the downed partner can prevent a defeat, puni."
"15d2abae","MP being reduced to 0 doesn't cause the same problem. Also,
MP slowly refills over time, puni."
"15d2abad","Of course, if you run out of MP you can't attack, so don't
go using it up all if you're looking to win, puni!"
"14d2aa39","The items you can use in battle are limited, puni. Let me
tell you about them, puni."
"14d2aa3a","You'll be using Recovery Discs the most, puni. They restore
a set amount of HP, puni."
"14d2aa3b","MP Discs are also important, puni. These will restore your
MP, puni."
"14d2aa3c","Regen Discs revive a Digimon when its HP hits zero, puni.
You're in trouble if you don't have one when you need it."
"14d2aa3d","Remedy Discs heal Status Abnormalities, puni. I'll explain
all the different kinds of Status Abnormalities separately."
"14d2aa3e","Plugins boost ATK and other stats during battle, puni."
"14d2aa3f","Holo-Discs are discs that affect a wide area. Use them well,
and you can affect both partners at once, puni."
"14d2aa30","That's the gist of it, puni. Keep as many Recovery Discs on
you as you can at all times, puni!"
"13d2a844","Next I'll tell you all about Status Abnormalities, puni."
"13d2a847","Some skills have secondary effects that can inflict Status
Abnormalities on your enemies, puni."
"13d2a846","Taking damage from a skill like that can also inflict such
Status Abnormalities on your own party, puni."
"13d2a841","These effects disappear after a certain amount of time, or
when the battle ends. Recovery Discs also fix them, puni."
"13d2a840","Also, if your partners have a high DigiFriend with each
other, they'll automatically heal the other's abnormality."
"13d2a843","Poison: HP progressively decreases.
Slow: Movements are slowed."
"13d2a842","Paralysis: Unable to move.
Confusion: Takes confused actions."
"13d2a84d","Rage: Targets the attacker.
Unjustified: Targets someone other than the attacker."
"13d2a84c","Sprite: Can only use weak inherent attack skills.
There... That's all seven of them, puni!"
"12d2a6d2","On the other hand, inflicting Status Abnormalities on foes
is better for you, puni. Try out skills with abnormalities!"
"12d2a6d3","Next I'll tell you all about Tactics, puni!"
"12d2a6d0","Tactics decide your overall plan, puni. Open Tactics with
<icon>□</icon>, puni."
"12d2a6d1","Press <icon>○</icon> immediately after opening to Escape, puni.
Running is a valid strategy, puni!"
"12d2a6d6","Press <icon>L</icon><icon>R</icon> to open panels with 
each partner's Battle Tactics, puni."
"12d2a6d7","You can ration how much MP to use, or change which enemy you
want to target, puni."
"12d2a6d4","Any MP limit will stay set that way from then on, puni.
You can also change this on your Digivice outside of battle."
"12d2a6d5","It's a good idea to change up your Tactics based on enemy
strength and attack skill MP usage ahead of time, puni."
"15d06d35","Here are some other details for you, puni."
"15d06d36","""Can you stack Status Abnormalities or Skill Increases?"" you
ask, puni."
"15d06d37","Up to three Status Abnormalities can stack at the same time,
puni. A fourth one will cause the first to disappear, puni."
"15d06d30","Skill Increases of the same type will overwrite each other,
puni. For example, if you use an Attack Plugin while ATK is"
"15d06d31","raised while Agitated, the effect period and amount will be
overwritten, to the same as if you had used it afterwards."
"16d06ea6","你想和強敵戰鬥噗尼…？
真厲害呢噗尼！"
"16d06ea5","使用「困難模式」
不使用「困難模式」
「困難模式」是什麼？"
"16d06ea4","變為「困難模式」了噗尼。
去外頭試著戰鬥看看就知道了噗尼…！"
"16d06ea3","不使用「困難模式」噗尼。
我知道了噗尼！"
"16d06ea2","所有敵人的強度將增強為2倍，
這就是「困難模式」噗尼…！"
"16d06ea1","我到底為什麼會被世界賦予更變模式的工作呢…！"
"16d06ea0","就算使用「困難模式」，
也不會特別得到什麼好處噗尼…"
"16d06eaf","所以我完全不推薦，
這是為了「就算這樣也沒關係」這樣經驗豐富的勇者而設的模式噗尼！"
"17d0701b","現在變為「困難模式」了噗尼。
要怎麼做？"
"17d07018","放棄使用「困難模式」
繼續「困難模式」
「困難模式」是什麼？"
"17d07019","敵人回復為原本的強度了唷，
想挑戰困難的時候隨時都可以來找我噗尼"
"17d0701e","維持「困難模式」對吧，
嗯，加油唷噗尼"
"18d0718c","噗尼尼！？
你正以「超困難模式」遊玩噗尼！"
"18d0718f","以「超困難模式」開始，直到下次繼承資料為止
難易度都將無法更變噗尼"
"18d0718e","順帶一提，在「超困難模式」裡
不但戰鬥中的敵人相當強大"
"18d07189","就連夥伴的能力成長都會被壓制，
非常的困難噗尼！"
"18d07188","但是也有一部分的事件，只能在超困難模式中看到…
不要氣餒努力加油唷噗尼！"
"4f1e416c","Ask me how to use the Dimensional Box!"
"4f1e416d","Ask me how to use the Dimensional Box! Oh, you can also
exchange Unknown Ultimate Digivolution Cores."
"4f1e416e","Your inventory is just so full!"
"501e42de","I'll tell you about the Dimensional Box!"
"501e42dd","This mysterious box next to me is called a Dimensional Box."
"501e42dc","This box is connected to another dimension. You can pull
items from the other dimension,"
"501e42db","or fight against Digimon from the other side!"
"501e42da","You can use <icon>○</icon> to test out all of these
functions, if you want! A menu will appear."
"501e42d9","I'll explain the menu another time."
"511e44b3","Now let me tell you about presents!"
"511e44b0","Sometimes presents will be delivered from another
dimension, they say."
"511e44b1","You can check a list of what's been sent. Selecting and
confirming any of these will send them into your inventory."
"511e44b6","You can't get any of these presents if your inventory is
full, so be careful!"
"511e44b7","Presents are sent with the input of Product Codes."
"521e4624","I'll tell you about <icon>NWP</icon> (Network Points)!"
"521e4627","<icon>NWP</icon> are collected in your Dimensional Box."
"521e4626","You can also get Network Points in Daily Quests and battles.
I'll talk about those later."
"521e4621","<icon>NWP</icon> you've collected can be exchanged for precious
items with Exchange Points."
"521e4620","I'll explain Exchange Points another time. Feel free to ask
about it whenever!"
"4b1e3b21","Listen up, and I'll tell you all about Exchange Points!"
"4b1e3b22","This function lets you exchange collected <icon>NWP</icon> for items!"
"4b1e3b23","The contents of the Exchange Item List can change slightly."
"4b1e3b24","Hmm...the lineup will change in what you humans call ""real
time,"" changing slightly every day."
"4c1e3c92","Lemme tell you about Daily Quests!"
"4c1e3c91","If you connect to the Dimensional Box, DigiMail will come
with Daily Quests!"
"4c1e3c90","Complete the terms detailed in the DigiMail to finish a
quest."
"4c1e3c97","A DigiMail will come announcing your success. Open it to
receive the <icon>NWP</icon>."
"4c1e3c96","The ""daily"" part of Daily Quests has to do with that ""real
time"" stuff."
"4c1e3c95","Don't forget to check these every day! Oh yeah, these quests
have completion deadlines, too."
"4c1e3c94","When you access the Dimensional Box the next day, the
previous day's content will be overwritten, so be careful!"
"4d1e3e07","Next I'll tell you about battles!"
"4d1e3e04","When you select Start Battle, a battle will start using the
data of your registered partner Digimon."
"4d1e3e05","I'll tell you how to register them another time."
"4d1e3e02","You will be matched automatically against opponents with
rankings as close to yours as possible."
"4d1e3e03","Battles are three-on-three and completely automatic, using
data from registered Digimon."
"4d1e3e00","Victory or defeat depends on the six base parameters and
basic nature of your partner Digimon."
"4d1e3e01","Winning earns you <icon>NWP</icon>. Consecutive victories
earn you more Network Points, I'm told!"
"4d1e3e0e","You can only battle once per day. Do your best to get that
<icon>NWP</icon>!"
"4e1e3ff8","I'll tell you about registering Digimon for battles!"
"4e1e3ffb","Register Digimon in Digimon Registration. You can register
three Key Chain Cages."
"4e1e3ffa","Choose a partner Digimon currently with you, and register
one at a time."
"4e1e3ffd","Once set, this partner cannot be registered again until its
Generation changes."
"4e1e3ffc","That's why for now, go ahead and register your current
partner Digimon into two cages."
"4e1e3fff","You can still engage in battle with an enemy cage, after
all. Of course, the empty slot will lose by default!"
"4e1e3ffe","Registered data will stay the same as long as it isn't
reregistered."
"4e1e3ff1","Even if your Digimon Digivolves or dies, the data will stay
the same as it was when you registered it."
"4e1e3ff0","If it gets weaker than it was before, it's best not to
reregister it."
"571e4dc5","So you wanna convert an Unknown Ultimate Digivolution Core!
Please choose what you want to convert it into."
"571e4dc6","A Summaesquetrine! This item lets you Digivolve a Mega
Digimon partner into Omegamon."
"571e4dc7","A Imperapugnine! This item lets you Digivolve a Mega Digimon
partner into Imperialdramon FM."
"571e4dc0","A Lanceaesquetrine! This item lets you Digivolve an Ultimate
Digimon partner into Gallantmon."
"571e4dc1","A Salicelerine! This item lets you Digivolve an Ultimate
Digimon partner into Susanoomon."
"571e4dc2","A Solluxine! This item lets you Digivolve an Ultimate
Digimon partner into ShineGreymon."
"571e4dc3","Oh, you want to quit? That's fine. Best to think these
things through."
"571e4dcc","Now, shall I convert the Unknown Ultimate Digivolution Core
to a Summaesquetrine?"
"571e4dcd","Now, shall I convert the Unknown Ultimate Digivolution Core
to a Imperapugnine?"
"581e4fb7","Now, shall I convert the Unknown Ultimate Digivolution Core
to a Lanceaesquetrine?"
"581e4fb6","Now, shall I convert the Unknown Ultimate Digivolution Core
to a Salicelerine?"
"581e4fb5","Now, shall I convert the Unknown Ultimate Digivolution Core
to a Solluxine?"
"581e4fb4","I changed my mind.
Yes, please convert it."
"581e4fb3","The Unknown Ultimate Digivolution Core was converted to
a Summaesquetrine!"
"581e4fb2","The Unknown Ultimate Digivolution Core was converted to
an Imperapugnine!"
"581e4fb1","The Unknown Ultimate Digivolution Core was converted to
a Lanceaesquetrine!"
"581e4fb0","The Unknown Ultimate Digivolution Core was converted to
a Salicelerine!"
"581e4fbf","The Unknown Ultimate Digivolution Core was converted to
a Solluxine!"
"581e4fbe","Oh dear, it looks like your inventory is full. Free up some
space!"
"de17cb97","I'll tell you what Jijimon taught me about Tamers!"
"de17cb96","Let's start with the basics."
"de17cb95","It's the job of a Tamer to live with partner Digimon and
support them in battles!"
"de17cb94","Your Tamer level will go up as you gain experience from
these battles."
"de17cb93","In other words, if you do what you're supposed to do, your
level will naturally go up."
"de17cb92","You can check on your Tamer level in the Tamer section of
your Digivice!"
"de17cb91","Let's talk about Tamer levels."
"de17cb90","Collect the required amount of Tamer experience to increase
your Tamer level."
"de17cb9f","Every time you raise your Tamer level, you'll receive
Tamer Points (TP)."
"de17cb9e","Use TP to acquire Tamer Skills!"
"dd17ca24","Tamer EXP is needed to raise your Tamer level."
"dd17ca25","I'll teach you how to increase your Tamer EXP!"
"dd17ca26","The first method is battle: the stronger the enemies you
face, the more you'll get."
"dd17ca27","Next is living with your Digimon. You'll get Tamer EXP when
Partner Digimon eat, sleep or go to the bathroom."
"dd17ca20","Lastly, walking is an unexpectedly important method! In the
city or in the field, you get Tamer EXP every time you move!"
"dd17ca21","Now, even if you accrue the necessary amount of Tamer EXP,
you can only level up in the city."
"dd17ca22","Once you'll filled up on EXP, you should probably head back
to the city for a spell."
"dd17ca23","Let me tell you about Tamer Skills!"
"dd17ca2c","You can check and acquire skills in the Tamer section of
your Digivice!"
"dd17ca2d","When you enter Acquire Skills, various skill group trees
will appear on the screen."
"e017cefd","Switch between groups using <icon>L</icon> or <icon>R</icon> to change the
group tree below."
"e017cefc","Skills are displayed in trees. Skills on the right side
require acquisition of the skills to the left first."
"e017ceff","You can get a general understanding of a skill before
acquiring it, so make sure to check it out first!"
"e017cefe","You say you want to redo your skills, do ya?! Well...
too bad, you can't do that yet."
"e017cef9","Still, if the city flourishes you might get your chance
somewhere down the line!"
"e017cef8","What's more, if your Tamer level is maxed up, they say you
can acquire all the skills."
"e017cefb","Instead of being a worrywart and hoarding your TP, maybe
it's best for you to just see what you can do with it!"
"e017cefa","Big news! Datamon is doing research in the lab on resetting
skills!"
"e017cef5","I wonder if you can finally reset your skills?! Go check it
out if you're curious!"
"d517bd45","Oh, is that right? Well, come back and see me anytime!"
"5766d366","Blub."
"5766d367","Blub-blub?"
"634b2539","A human, it's a human!!!"
"634b2538","Time to explain Builders! Woohoo!"
"634b253b","You can upgrade the buildings in the city, but ya need
materials to do it!"
"634b253a","Upgrades require some time to complete. After time passes,
go to the location of the building to complete the process."
"634b253d","Upgrading leads to all kinds of good things, but it won't
increase your Prosperity!"
"634b253c","The Square is a bit special...when the seasons change, the
upgrades will reset!"
"634b253f","It seems that upgrading the Square leads to good things that
last only for that season!"
"7ce94748","I want to make the city even more wonderful!"
"7ce94749","Hooray! The city's gotten bigger!"
"f24cbc03","This is the city of Floatia. ""It's a village,"" you say?
I said it's a city, so it's a city!"
"f24cbc02","This is the grand city of Floatia. Magnificent, isn't it?!"
"e16796f8","Pi-chi-chi! Do you know about Old Cards?"
"e16796f9","They appear sometimes when you pick up materials."
"e16796fa","The cards you get are stored on your partners' bodies, and
automatically transfer to the city storage."
"e16796fb","I wonder what they are... They're just so old, what can they
be good for?"
"e16796fc","Pi-chi-chi! You're gathering Old Cards?"
"e16796fd","I hear there's a Digimon somewhere in the world that can
restore Old Cards to their original state..."
"e16796fe","Myotismon restores Old Cards to DigiCards, and displays them
in the museum. Amazing!"
"2e019396","This city is so safe, sometimes I get the urge to go
traveling, you know?"
"2e019397","The city's gotten so big, sometimes I get lost in it."
"2e019394","Datamon? Oh, you mean that tiny machine Digimon..."
"2e019395","Yeah, I seen 'im in Nigh Plains! Somewhere near the...
old cableway, I think?"
"f715efc7","Good luck out there, {0}! It's not much, but
all of us here got these items for you."
"f715efc6","You got Portable Toilet x 2!"
"f715efc5","You got Band-Aid x 3!"
"f715efc4","You got Recovery Disc x 5!"
"f715efc3","You got MP Disc x 5!"
"f715efc2","You got Regen Disc x 3!"
"f715efc1","You got Digistalk x 10!"
"f715efc0","You can use these items by opening Care Mode with <icon>□</icon>."
"f715efcf","Be sure to check item effect descriptions before using them!"
"f715efce","We'll gather more later, so come back tomorrow!"
"f615ee54","We're gathering items now, so give us a bit more time. Come
back again tomorrow!"
"f213a9b1","啊，生病了嗎！？
不快使用藥品治療…　但是藥品也是很貴重的呢…"
"ea115e62","我們會努力尋找藥品，
如果明天還是生病狀態的話，就來這裡吧！"
"f615ee55","We gathered more items, so here you go!"
"f615ee56","You got a Portable Toilet!"
"f615ee57","You got a Recovery Disc!"
"f615ee50","You got a MP Disc!"
"f615ee51","You got Medicine!"
"f615ee52","You got an Auto-Pilot!"
"f615ee53","You got Medicine x 2!"
"f615ee5c","You got a Regen Disc!"
"f915f32c","You got a Medium Recovery Disc!"
"f915f32f","You got a Medium MP Disc!"
"f915f32e","You got Medium Recovery Disc x 2!"
"f915f329","You got Medium MP Disc x 2!"
"f915f328","You got Regen Disc x 2!"
"f615ee5d","Huh? I can't give you the items I've gathered. Make more
room in your inventory first!"
"f915f32d","You seem a bit sick, are you okay? I gave you some medicine,
so please use it!"
"dd77cdb8","Yo, here for some training? Then you'll want to use this
white machine here."
"dd77cdb9","When you train, power will build up in the training gear."
"dd77cdba","When the power fills up...you can improve that gear!"
"dd77cdbb","But there's no Digimon in the city that can do improvements
yet..."
"dd77cdbc","Usable power is displayed in the growing bar over the panel
when you select Training."
"dd77cdbd","When the bar fills up, you can ask Kabuterimon over there
to improve your training gear."
"1fca932","Oh, {0}! Hold on!"
"12fcc3f5","Thank you for saving us, {0}! Oh, and..."
"1fca933","I'll show you around Floatia and teach you all sorts of
things! Interested?"
"1fca930","Yes, please do!
That's okay, I'll walk around myself."
"1fca931","Eh heh heh, all right, I'll show you around!"
"1fca936","Really? You sure? How independent of you!"
"1fca937","If you have any trouble, me and the other Digimon know a few
things here and there. Try talking to us, anytime!"
"1fca934","The Meat Fields are next to Jijimon's house here!"
"1fca935","Tanemon is in charge of the Meat Fields! I'll let him tell
you all about it!"
"1fca93a","When your partners are hungry, give them some meat you've
picked up!"
"9fcb5f8","When your partners are hungry, give them some meat! Come and
get some more again later!"
"1fca93b","If they eat, well... you-know-what comes out! That's why we
have a bathroom here."
"2fcaaa5","If your partner Digimon asks for a bathroom break, you'd
better hurry on over here!"
"2fcaaa4","Next to that is the Training Hall."
"2fcaaa7","The Training Hall's a very important facility. They'll
explain everything when you go inside."
"2fcaaa6","The Training Hall is a place to train your partner Digimon!"
"2fcaaa1","For now, I'll give you a real rough run-down!"
"2fcaaa0","Touch this white apparatus here to do some training. The
Training Input Panel will pop up!"
"2fcaaa3","Set and confirm whatever gear you want for partner Digimon L
and R! Controls are labeled underneath the panel."
"2fcaaa2","One time takes a single hour, and makes a Digimon tired.
Keep an eye on the <icon>疲労</icon> (Fatigue) gauge!"
"2fcaaad","If they get too fatigued, they could get sick, or their Life
could diminish. If that happens, let them rest on this bed."
"2fcaaac","Talk to Gigimon when its time to rest. When the Sleep sign
appears, let them sleep in Care Mode."
"fffca5ec","The Training Panel setup is a little hard to understand,
but go ahead and give it a shot!"
"fffca5ed","If there's anything you don't get after that, ask Tsunomon
and Motimon about it!"
"fffca5ee","Oh yeah, there's a bathroom in the Training Hall, so use it
when you're in here."
"fffca5ef","Oh wow, you Digivolved through training! Now you won't have
any problems outside the city."
"fffca5e8","You're going out? I think you'd better at least Digivolve to
Rookie first..."
"fffca5e9","A Digimon becomes a Rookie about nine hours after In-
Training II, and can definitely Digivolve into something."
"fffca5ea","I'm going out now.
I'll think it over."
"fffca5eb","Really? You should definitely do some training later, then!"
"fffca5e4","You're gonna stick around a little longer? No pain, no gain!"
"fffca5e5","Hey now! You gotta train at least once!"
"fca75f","All right, here's the last thing to explain."
"fca75e","There ain't anything around here yet, but if you get a bunch
more Digimon to come here...call 'em, or bring 'em..."
"fca75d","they could build facilities and get to work... It all
depends on the effort you put in, {0}!"
"fca75c","This exit takes you out of the city. Outside there are
Digimon that will attack you..."
"fca75b","If you play it right, you could avoid battles entirely.
If things get dicey, head back to the city!"
"fca75a","One more thing. You can open the Digivice menu by
pressing <icon>△</icon>."
"fca759","You can check Tamer and partner info, as well as DigiMails
sent to you there. You can save, too!"
"fca758","Finally...if you have any trouble, the Digimon in the city
know all sorts of things, so ask them!"
"fca757","That's the end of my explanation! Thanks for listening."
"fca756","I'm always in Jijimon's house, so come visit! Come on back
sometime!"
"7c494969","I'll teach you about living around here! What would you like
to know?"
"7b4947f7","I'll tell you about the basics of life here!"
"7b4947f4","Compared to other Digimon, your two partner Digimon hide an
amazing power within them!"
"7b4947f5","But in order to unleash this power, they'll need your help."
"7b4947f2","First, they'll only eat, sleep, and use the bathroom on your
command!"
"7b4947f3","When the meat mark appears, they want to eat. Open Care with
<icon>□</icon>, and give them a food item."
"7b4947f0","When the poop mark appears, they need to use the bathroom.
You can take them to the bathroom, or use a Portable Toilet."
"7b4947f1","When the ZZZ mark appears, they want to sleep. Open Care
with <icon>□</icon>, and let them sleep."
"7b4947fe","If you don't take care of these in a certain amount of time,
it'll cause a Training Failure."
"7b4947ff","Be sure not to miss any of those signs."
"7a494602","Now, about <icon>疲労</icon> (Fatigue) and sickness!"
"7a494601","When the sweat mark appears, fatigue has built up. It's bad
news if the <icon>疲労</icon> gauge is more than half full."
"7a494600","Training and battle are the main causes of fatigue. Look for
a place to rest!"
"7a494607","If they get too fatigued...they can get sick or their Life
could diminish!"
"7a494606","If they get sick, a sickness mark will appear. Give them
medicine, or find a place to heal the sickness."
"7a494605","Digimon lose HP, MP and Life if they're sick. Hurry up and
cure them!"
"7a494604","Injuries and major injuries are kind of like sickness..."
"7a49460b","If battle ends with only a little HP, it may result in an
injury or major injury."
"7a49460a","Injuries can be healed with band-aids, medicine, going to a
place that heals them, or sleep. Major injuries are harder."
"79494491","Let's talk about life and death."
"79494492","Your partner Digimon are born with a set amount of Life."
"79494493","They will lose more Life as time goes on. If they lose all
of it, they'll die..."
"79494494","But your partners are special. If they die, they'll be
reborn immediately!"
"79494495","When reborn, they need to be raised from scratch, but they
inherit a certain amount of skills."
"79494496","The higher their skills when they die, the higher they'll be
when they're reborn."
"80494f94","Let's talk about partner Generations and Digivolution!"
"80494f97","The older your partner gets, the more likely it will
Digivolve to the next Generation."
"80494f96","The Generations are In-Training I, In-Training II, Rookie,
Champion, and Ultimate... and maybe even higher!"
"80494f91","Once a partner has lived a certain length of time, a chance
to Digivolve will present itself."
"80494f90","There are all sorts of conditions necessary to Digivolve.
High skill, Training Failures, Weight, Discipline..."
"80494f93","Each Digivolving Digimon has different requirements. Open up
your Digivice and try looking at your partner's history."
"80494f92","At first, all of the conditions will appear hidden, but they
will slowly become clear over time."
"80494f9d","If a Digimon Digivolves, their Life increases. Of course,
higher Generation Digimon make you stronger in battle."
"80494f9c","Try to Digivolve your partners to higher Generations!"
"7f494e23","Let's talk about Bonds and DigiFriends!"
"7f494e20","You can check Bond and DigiFriend levels by opening your
Digivice."
"7f494e21","Bond is a value that represents how much you relate to your
Digimon."
"7f494e26","The higher it is, the stronger you are in battle."
"7f494e27","DigiFriend is a value representing the camaraderie between
your partners."
"7f494e24","If this value is high, your partners will help each other
out in Battle."
"7f494e25","These values are related to several other factors as well,
such as Digivolution. The higher they are, the better!"
"7f494e2a","They increase through communication, eating, and sleeping,
all of which are explained other places."
"7e494c4e","Let me tell you about <icon>機嫌</icon> (Mood)."
"7e494c4d","<icon>機嫌</icon> is a value showing your partner's Mood,
which is displayed as a gauge."
"7e494c4c","The higher the Mood value, the stronger they are in battle."
"7e494c4b","A lot of things can raise Mood, but sleeping will return it
back to normal the next day."
"7e494c4a","Even if it goes back to normal, there's a bit of variation
in that initial value. Some days are better than others!"
"7e494c49","Well, the higher it is the better, but don't worry about it
too much, okay?!"
"7d494add","Let me tell you about <icon>躾け</icon> (Discipline)."
"7d494ade","<icon>躾け</icon> is a value showing how serious your partner
is, displayed as a gauge."
"7d494adf","This increases or decreases through communication, and even
through eating."
"7d494ad8","<icon>躾け</icon> is only related to Digivolution."
"7d494ad9","Whether they become an upstanding Digimon or a mischievous
Digimon depends on their <icon>躾け</icon> level."
"844955c0","Let me tell you about <icon>呪い</icon> (Curse)."
"844955c3","If you don't answer bathroom requests in time, well... uh...
they'll have a little accident..."
"844955c2","When that happens, <icon>呪い</icon> will increase!"
"844955c5","Why is it called ""Curse,"" you say? Well, if <icon>呪い</icon> increases 16
times, who knows what'll happen..."
"844955c4","At any rate, something nasty is sure to happen... so be
careful!"
"8349546f","Let me tell you about communication!"
"8349546c","Communication is a moment of rapport with your partner
Digimon that occurs unpredictably."
"8349546d","During communication, you can choose to Praise, Scold, or
Ignore your Digimon."
"8349546a","As a result, your partner's Bond, DigiFriend, <icon>機嫌</icon>,
or <icon>躾け</icon> will be altered."
"8349546b","Also, the info needed to Digivolve to the next Generation
will be made clear."
"83495468","The best option to choose depends on the situation, so I
can't give you any advice."
"83495469","Try different options and figure it out yourself!"
"2faf4c4b","I'm a master at training! Go on, ask me anything!"
"2faf4c4a","All finished? Come back again soon!"
"2faf4c49","Digimon need training more than anything else! It helps with
battle strength and Digivolution."
"2faf4c48","You can set your Partner L and R Digimon to use their own
gear, or you can let them rest."
"2faf4c4f","The gear you pick changes the skills raised. What's more,
adjacent gear raises skills a bit more!"
"2faf4c4e","Training increases Fatigue. The <icon>疲労</icon> icon bar shows how
much Fatigue has built up."
"2faf4c4d","If Digimon get too fatigued, they can get sick or lose Life!
How awful!"
"2faf4c4c","Rest will relieve a little Fatigue. Let either partner rest
while training, or let them rest in that bed over there."
"2faf4c43","There are also some training bonuses you can get!"
"2faf4c42","Bonuses increase skills or reduce Fatigue."
"2eaf4ad8","There are plenty of bonus combos to be had, so try them all
out!"
"2eaf4ad9","These are the different kinds of bonuses!"
"2eaf4ada","First, the simple ones: Buddy and Rival."
"2eaf4adb","For Buddy, just set your partners on neighboring gear.
They'll both get bonuses."
"2eaf4adc","For Rival, set your partners on opposite gear.
They'll both get bonuses."
"2eaf4add","There are timing-related bonuses, too."
"2eaf4ade","Day is easy to understand. Some gear gains bonuses on
certain days, other than Sunday."
"2eaf4adf","Time is a bit trickier. Each Digimon has their own special
time for these. You have to figure them out yourself!"
"2eaf4ad0","Growth Spurt: This is a special one. If your partners are
different Generations, the bonus goes to the younger one."
"2eaf4ad1","Training has many effects, and reduces the time needed for
Digivolution!"
"31af4f91","There are even more bonuses!"
"31af4f90","Mood: You'll get a bonus if <icon>機嫌</icon> is over 80.
The effect is even stronger at 100!"
"31af4f90","Mood: You'll get a bonus if <icon>機嫌</icon> is over 80.
The effect is even stronger at 100!"
"31af4f93","Food: This requires some prep work. Certain food increases
the effects of Training."
"31af4f92","The effects end after around six hours. Be sure to train a
lot during that period!"
"31af4f95","Next I'll tell you about Special Roulette!"
"31af4f94","After you select Training, a roulette wheel will appear."
"31af4f97","Land on the right spot, and you can increase skills
by 1.25x! Now that's a deal!"
"31af4f96","The number of bonuses increases the hit spots. Like killing
two birds with one stone!"
"31af4f99","Finally, getting one hit will add a W-marked hit spot next
time. Aim for consecutive hits!"
"681c659c","You're that human Tamer, ain'tcha. Nice to meet ya, the
name's Tanemon!"
"681c659d","From now on, I'll give you tasty meat from this here field."
"681c659e","Huh? ""How do you get meat from a field,"" you ask? Why,
what's so weird about that?"
"681c659f","Never really thought about it, to be honest. Now then, here!"
"681c6598","You got Meat x 10!"
"681c6599","You'll get your next share tomorrow. If it's not enough, go
get some mushrooms or something outside."
"681c659a","I already gave you today's share! You gotta wait until
tomorrow for more."
"681c659b","Right-o, here's your meat for today!"
"681c6594","Thanks to Palmon, we can grow more meat every day! Right-o,
here's your meat for today."
"681c6595","You got Meat x 8!"
"691c670f","You got Meat x 5!"
"711c73ee","Right-o, here's your meat for toda--waaaait a minute, your
inventory is full, so I won't give you any more!"
"6e1ead81","Hmm, I wanted to give you some meat, but you don't have any
room to hold it!"
"6e1ead80","Ah well... Come back and get it when you've freed up some
space, will ya?"
"6e1ead83","Without meat, I imagine you'll run out of food...although
I guess you could always go out and get some mushrooms."
"6a1c68e2","You want to plow the fields? We can plow for about an hour."
"6a1c68e3","Oh hey, all of the fields are already in their best
condition! You can expect a nice crop from these!"
"6a1c68e0","Plow the fields!
Not now..."
"6a1c68e1","Huh, you don't wanna? Hmph..."
"6a1c68e6","Your partners plowed the fields! The fields improved!"
"6a1c68e7","Your partners' STR has increased, but they're a little tired
now."
"6a1c68e4","Good work, everyone!"
"ee7dac2d","Resting on this bed will ease some of that fatigue! Want to
rest for an hour?!"
"ee7dac2c","Rest.
We're still okay."
"ee7dac2f","Right! Sleep tight, guys!"
"ee7dac2e","Your partner has recovered a fair bit of Fatigue!"
"ee7dac29","Whoa, you're not gonna rest?! Keep up the good work!"
"ee7dac28","Neither of your partners are fatigued! Come back when one's
tired."
"1a45347e","Come on, come on!!!"
"1a45347f","If you're sleepy, you should get some rest right away!"
"1a45347c","Well I guess you'd drift off on your own eventually, but if
you do that'll cause a Training Failure."
"1a45347d","Even if you hold out as much as you can, you'll just wake up
that much later the next morning."
"1a45347a","Lookit all these shops!"
"1a45347b","And they don't even close up at night, that's awesome! Kinda
makes me wanna be a night owl for once..."
"80a6486f","I'm helping out with the meat cultivation!"
"80a6486e","What magnificent fields they've become! Let me explain a bit
about them."
"80a6486d","Palmon is looking after cultivation of the fields here in
the Agricultural District."
"80a6486c","Each field lets you replant crops. I leave it to you to pick
the meat and veggies you know!"
"80a6486b","You can choose from any meat or veggies you've obtained at
least once. Don't worry, you won't lose any items!"
"80a6486a","Tanemon will look after the fields. Fields have three status
levels: Normal, Good and Perfect."
"80a64869","The better the status, the more crops you can get, and
sometimes a crop takes fewer days to grow!"
"80a64868","Talk to Tanemon, cultivate your fields, and raise their
levels. Let Tanemon decide which ones get cultivated!"
"80a64867","A field's status level will go down when it is harvested a
bunch. Might as well go cultivate more in your free time!"
"78f97e08","Training is focused around adjusting Digivolution-related
skills, but another important part is food effects!"
"78f97e09","Food items are divided into eight types, and each one has
its own characteristics. Wanna hear about 'em?"
"78f97e0a","Sure! Let's hear it.
No thanks."
"78f97e0b","Just ask if you ever wanna know!"
"78f97e0c","Meat: Weight and <icon>機嫌</icon> (Mood) go up more easily, and does a
good job of satisfying a Digimon's hunger."
"78f97e0d","Fruit: <icon>機嫌</icon> (Mood) goes up more easily, and removes
<icon>疲労</icon> (Fatigue)."
"78f97e0e","Vegetable: Raises the amount abilities increase during
training for a set time. Also raises <icon>躾け</icon> (Discipline)."
"78f97e0f","Wild Mushroom: Reduces Weight, and removes Fatigue. Not very
good at satisfying hunger, though."
"78f97e00","Nut: Eating these as-is reduces <icon>躾け</icon> (Discipline) and
does not satisfy hunger very well. Great when cooked..."
"78f97e01","Drink: Raises <icon>機嫌</icon> (Mood) and removes Fatigue. These also
raise DigiFriend. Sold in vending machines."
"79f97ffb","Fish: Reduces <icon>躾け</icon> (Discipline) and raises Bond. You can
get these by fishing."
"79f97ffa","See, they have all kinds of characteristics. Use different
types of food depending on the situation!"
"79f97ff9","The Training Hall's moved here now! Sweet digs, huh?!"
"79f97ff8","Oh, did you want to ask about food effects?"
"c0db4d57","You can ask me anything about adventuring!"
"c0db4d56","This world is split into eight separate areas. Who knows
what's going on in those strange lands..."
"c0db4d55","You can overcome anything if you're with your partners! But
still, there are certain things you should know."
"c0db4d54","I'll teach you all about those sort of things. Ask me if you
want!"
"c0db4d53","The fields are chock-full of danger. There's a few things
you'd be better off remembering."
"c0db4d52","You can consider pretty much all of the Digimon out there
as your enemies. Well, most of the time...but not always."
"c0db4d51","If a Digimon doesn't try to attack you, approaching it and
pressing <icon>○</icon> might let you talk to it."
"c0db4d50","Talking might then lead to a battle, but who knows?!"
"c0db4d5f","Edible items grow in the field, and drop from time to time."
"c0db4d5e","You'll find them if you keep your eyes on the ground when
you walk. There are all kinds of fruit, mushrooms and nuts!"
"bfdb4be4","Gathered items will respawn in the same place if you leave
the area...well, sometimes."
"bfdb4be5","Remember where food drops, and be sure to check those spots
when you roll through!"
"bfdb4be6","There are places in the field where you can get materials."
"bfdb4be7","When you see a colored halo on the ground, a rectangular
object will appear out of it."
"bfdb4be0","There are four types of materials: wood (green), stone
(red), metal (yellow), and liquid (blue)."
"bfdb4be1","When you approach material, your partner Digimon can
collect it."
"bfdb4be2","Wonder what kind of materials your partner Digimon are good
at finding? This depends on their Nature and Generation."
"bfdb4be3","Collected materials will be stored on your partners' bodies.
The higher their STA, the more they can hold."
"bfdb4bec","You can see what materials you're holding from the Material
tab in the Item section of your Digivice."
"bfdb4bed","When you return to the city, materials will automatically
transfer to city storage."
"c2db50bd","Materials will disappear for a while if you keep collecting
them, but they'll reappear in about a day."
"c2db50bc","Now let me tell you what to do with materials you collect."
"c2db50bf","Materials are used to upgrade the buildings in the city.
That's why you'll need a Builder."
"c2db50be","You'll have to look for a Digimon to set you up with a
Builder, or those materials will be useless..."
"c2db50b9","We finally got that Builder you wanted!"
"c2db50b8","Bring back a bunch of materials so we can upgrade these
buildings!"
"c2db50bb","If you have one of those Tent items, you should be able to
camp out..."
"c2db50ba","If a Digimon that can make Tents comes to the city, I want
them to teach me about camping."
"c2db50b5","A Digimon that can make Tents has come to the Item Shop!"
"c2db50b4","If you have a Tent, you can camp from Care Mode."
"c1db4eca","Camping lets you rest and use the bathroom."
"c1db4ecb","You also can cook food and organize gathered materials.
Isn't that great?"
"c1db4ec8","You want to rename your partner Digimon? Okay, I got you
covered!"
"c1db4ec9","No, I changed my mind.
I want to change {1}'s name.
I want to change {2}'s name."
"c1db4ece","啊，9個文字以上的名字，
要注意一但變更後，就無法復原囉"
"b7db3f04","Just let me know if you wanna change it!"
"b7db3f05","See you next time!"
"5ceb2d5b","Oh, yoo-hoo! Over here, over here, {0}!"
"5ceb2d5a","Lookit all these Digimon on the job! I wonder what I should
do around here?"
"5ceb2d59","It'd be nice if I could do something that makes everyone
happy..."
"4a94a340","I wanna throw a festival in the plaza! I asked the Builder
about it..."
"4a94a341","Turns out you gotta do different preparations every season.
Ain't that a pain?"
"4a94a342","Time for the Spring Festival!"
"4a94a343","""It isn't spring without a flower festival."" That's what
Jijimon said!"
"4a94a344","I took the opportunity to stock up! Go ahead and buy some!"
"4a94a345","Time for the Summer Festival!"
"4a94a346","Summer here is all about castle towers and big old taiko
drums, huh? So cool!"
"4a94a347","I got a bunch of summery items in stock! Come check 'em out!"
"4a94a348","Time for the Fall Festival!"
"4a94a349","Halloween? First I've ever heard of it, but sounds like a
good time!"
"4b94a533","You want fall items, I got 'em! Get 'em while they're hot!"
"4b94a532","Time for the Winter Festival!"
"4b94a531","This is what they call ""Christmas,"" huh? Lookit all the
glitzy decorations!"
"4b94a530","I got plenty of party favors to go around! Come take a look!"
"9ee2e6b4","Aw jeez, I'm a bit bashful, ya know... This place seems
perfect for me..."
"9ee2e6b5","You should come by later, when it gets dark out... I'll see
you then!"
"91393e2f","I love this time of day!"
"91393e2e","Gabumon shared his happiness with you!
Your partners' Mood went up!"
"91393e2d","It's hard for me to get pep in my step around this time...
I stand out too much when it's bright."
"91393e2c","Nighttime's the right time for me! So nice and peaceful."
"24863015","Hi there! I'm helping out my favorite teacher!"
"24863014","For the sake of my education, keep on using Sender!
You'll get something good out of it."
"2ad82a3e","The more my teacher works, the more I get to study, see..."
"2ad82a3f","We'll give you a present every ten times you use Sender!"
"2ad82a3c","Hmm...I see Sender's been used ten times! Have some
Auto-Pilots!"
"2ad82a3d","You got Auto-Pilot x 5!"
"2ad82a3a","What's this...? You don't have any space in your inventory."
"2ad82a3b","You haven't used it another ten times yet. Keep it up!"
"cf43d955","Why hello! I've just started working here myself."
"cf43d954","This is the Warehouse! You can store and withdraw items as
you see fit!"
"cf43d957","Store
Withdraw
Exit"
"cf43d956","See you again!"
"9534d83f","What it is, {0}? Thanks for coming on over!"
"9534d83e","C'mon, don't front on me! You know why you're here,
this is an item shop, after all!"
"9534d83d","You wanna buy, you can buy. Got something to sell, I'm your
'mon! That's how we do it here."
"9534d83c","We're not 100% official as of yet, if you know'm sayin', but
this Item Shop is open for business!"

of paint, another upgrade, and a slick product selection!"
"9434d64f","Now then, whatcha gonna buy to commemorate our for-real

"aa2618d8","Heyah, how's it goin'?! Thanks for your help before."
"aa2618d9","This is what they call a Fishing Hole, yeah? Seems like a
good time!"
"aa2618da","I've put together something to make fishing even more fun:
new lures!"
"aa2618db","But I'll only exchange them for the fish I want! They're
pretty awesome, whaddaya expect?"
"aa2618dc","Ah, well no need to rush, it's not like they're going
anywhere. Come back anytime you want!"
"1d1b0af3","Yo, down for some hardcore fishing action?!"
"1d1b0af2","Wow, I can't believe you've gotten all the lures! There
ain't nothing more I can do for you."
"1d1b0af1","But I'll only exchange them for the fish I want! They're
pretty awesome, whaddaya expect?"
"1d1b0af0","Exchange Digiloach x 10 for the Snake Lure."
"1d1b0af7","Exchange Digitrout x 10 for the Frog Lure."
"1d1b0af6","Exchange Digiarowana x 10 for the Crayfish Lure."
"1d1b0af5","Bring them here once you have enough!"
"1d1b0af4","You brought ten Digiloaches! All right, here's your Snake
Lure!"
"1d1b0afb","You got a Snake Lure!"
"1d1b0afa","The Snake Lure makes it easy to fish small fry. Use this to
go after the tiny ones!"
"1c1b0900","You brought ten Digitrouts! All right, here's your Frog
Lure!"
"1c1b0901","You got a Frog Lure!"
"1c1b0902","The Frog Lure makes it easy to fish big game. Use this to
go after the large ones!"
"1c1b0903","You brought ten Digiarowanas! All right, here's your
Crayfish Lure!"
"1c1b0904","You got a Crayfish Lure!"
"1c1b0905","The Crayfish Lure is good for medium to big-sized game. Good
for balanced angling."
"f7a8ac99","Eh heh heh, well look what the cat dragged in. Leave all the
fieldwork to me!"
"f7a8ac98","This field is a bit small, so it'll be hard to do any major
improvements..."
"f7a8ac9b","Still, for now let's work on upping the crop yield! Here we
go!"
"f7a8ac9a","It looks like this field can grow crops other than the usual
meat!"
"f7a8ac9d","You can still increase its size, which will let you grow all
kinds of crops at the same time!"
"f7a8ac9c","All right, I'll leave the upgrade to you!"
"fcbd7222","Eh heh heh, did you come to see how your crops are coming?
Want to replant some crops while you're at it?"
"fcbd7223","Eh heh heh, gonna replant your crops?"
"fcbd7220","Okay then, bye bye now!"
"fcbd7221","Eh heh heh, I worked together with Tanemon to improve the
way we grow meat!"
"fcbd7226","A bigger field would be reaaal nice right about now..."
"6061e453","What it is, {0}! Ain't it a bee-yoootiful day?!"
"6061e452","Hee hee, I went and set up a Builder! Pretty sweet, right?"
"6061e451","But this Builder still isn't finished. If the city doesn't
get bigger, it'll be like a lil' paper-mache town..."
"6061e450","Still, it's not like I'm playing around. I'm taking stock of
all the materials in city storage."
"6061e457","It looks like no one's been taking inventory of these babies
at all! Once the city gets bigger,"
"6061e456","and the Builder starts operating, we'll be able to use all
sorts of materials. I can't wait for that day to come!"
"6061e455","Thanks for coming, {0}! Take a look, isn't
my Builder bee-yoootiful now?!"
"6061e454","We can use the materials you've collected up to now to
upgrade your facilities!"
"6061e45b","You can also see how much of each material you've collected.
Now then, keep those upgrade requests coming!"
"ee0ac378","Jeez, this city should hurry up and grow already... Oh hey,
you want to know how much material you've got in storage?"
"ee0ac379","Hey hey! Ready to rebuild some facilities? Or how about
checking your materials? You want it, you got it!"
"ee0ac37a","Thanks man, take it easy. And don't be a stranger!"
"ee0ac37b","DigiDeepwater: {13}  DigiAcid: {14}

real nice to me, that's for sure."
"befe00a5","But still, I want to be helpful to you somehow! Hmm, What to
do, what to do..."
"befe00a6","Oh, I know! Do you know what ""preferences"" are?"
"befe00a7","All Digimon have a preferred food. For example, I'm a fan of
wild mushrooms myself..."
"befe00a0","Everyone likes one of the seven kinds of food. Some of us
even have an extra-special favorite!"
"befe00a1","Favorites aren't just about type... They're more specific
than that. Sometimes it's not an ingredient, but cooking..."
"befe00a2","Digimon roll through preferences whenever they Digivolve to
a different type."
"befe00a3","Favorites never change; once a Digimon's picked one, they
stick with that until they're reborn."
"befe00ac","It'd be a pain to remember everyone's preferences, so I'll
keep track of what your partner Digimon like!"
"befe00ad","You should come ask whenever one of them Digivolves. Now
then..."
"3155219f","Oh, you came to ask about preferences! Hmm...okay, let me
see here..."
"3155219e","{1}'s preference is...
{20}!"
"3155219d","{1}'s favorite is...
{19}!"

it looks like they don't have one yet!"

{17}!"
"31552199","{2}'s favorite...
it looks like they don't have one yet!"

Something good will come of it, I'm sure!"

"de65fa8b","I'm working at a restaurant now. I get to sneak a bit of

"38bd713","Thanks for coming!"
"f884df88","{0}...for now on, I am at your beck and call."
"f884df89","Now then, I would like to open a restaurant in this city..."
"f884df8a","But it will take some time to prepare. My apologies..."
"f884df8b","I have fulfilled my dream of cooking in the city. Do come
and try my food sometime."
"6a3c9d23","You can eat Japanese cuisine and learn the etiquette."
"6a3c9d22","Until then."

let's get to it..."

"34b157ed","This is the Colosseum. Well...a virtual one."
"34b157ec","That's why you can choose your opponents anytime. We've
prepared a few challenges for you!"
"34b157eb","Also, we've got some special rules... Wanna hear them?"
"34b157ea","It's a virtual arena, so you won't take any real damage if
you lose. On the other hand, you won't grow stronger either."
"34b157e9","If you win you'll get <icon>LUCK</icon> (Luck Coins), but you can only
get one reward from each match in a single day."
"34b157e8","If you win a whole bunch, more and more matches will appear.
Aim for the top!"

my little secret..."
"55e9772e","I accept metal or stone for exchange, depending on the day
of the week. G'wan, try it out!"
"68400127","Why don't we exchange materials?"
"68400126","I'll exchange metal on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays."
"68400125","I'll exchange stone on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays."

"c22f088d","Hey, this is a nice place here."
"c22f088c","I'm pretty good at finding items, y'know. Gather a bunch of
items and sell them at this store,"
"c22f088f","and you can eat some delicious stuff at the restaurant!
Sweet deal, right?"
"c22f088e","Well lookit you, bringing all these goodies along! I have to

"fb561fc8","I'll play!
I don't want to play.
What are the rules?"
"fb561fcb","It costs 100 <icon>LUCK</icon>, or if you duh, don't have that, I can
take 1,000 <icon>BIT</icon>. Looks like you have enough."
"fb561fca","It costs 100 <icon>LUCK</icon>, or if you duh, don't have that, I can

"11073d89","It's spring and time for cherry blossoms!
This is the song for a relaxing spring!"
"11073d8a","Hey, ho! Summer is here!
This is the song for an all-out summer!"
"11073d8b","It's autumn! Harvest season!
Bring on an autumn romance with this song!"
"11073d8c","Winter! It might be cold but we're having fun!
This is the song for happening parties!"
"11073d8d","Celebrating makes you happy!
Partner <icon>機嫌</icon> increased!"
"11073d8e","Everyone loves having a good time!"
"bde46c46","Hey, I'm going to open an Item Shop!"
"bde46c47","Unexpected, you say?
Hehe, you're half-right!"
"bde46c44","I'm not going to sell and buy items!
I'll be making and repairing tents!"
"bde46c45","What's that? You don't have a tent?
Then you need to take this right away!"
"bde46c42","You got a Tent (Valuable) from Greymon!"
"bde46c43","This is one of my old tents, but it's still totally usable!"
"bde46c40","To use it, open Care from <icon>□</icon> and select Camp."
"bde46c41","Durability will decrease each time you use it, though.
Repairing it will restore it, so come see me."
"bde46c4e","If its Durability hasn't reached zero, it's a piece of cake!
I'll fix it for free!"
"bde46c4f","If its Durability hits zero, though, that's another story.
In that case, I'll have to charge you to repair it."
"bee46e39","If you go camping, you can do all kinds of things.
Go to the bathroom, cook, gather materials..."
"bee46e38","Why don't you try it out? That'll be best.
If you need help, come see me again!"
"56f40a9d","Hey there, what do you need?"
"56f40a9c","Could you fix my tent?
I need an explanation of camping.
Do you have any better tents?"
"56f40a9f","Could you fix my tent?
I need an explanation of camping.
Never mind."
"55f4092b","Okay, it'll be fixed in a jiffy..."
"55f40928","What's this?
You broke it?"
"55f40929","There's no use crying over spilt milk, but it'll cost you
to fix it. 1,000 <icon>BIT</icon>."
"55f4092e","Greymon fixed your Tent.
The Durability is back to normal!"
"55f4092f","Okay, then.
Next time, come see me before it gets broken."
"55f4092c","I'll pay to have it fixed.
No, I changed my mind."
"55f4092d","What? You don't have enough money?
I'm sorry, but you'll need to remedy that."
"55f40922","You changed your mind?
You're a regular weather vane, you are..."
"54f407b6","More about camping? It's a little long. Listen up!"
"54f407b5","You start camping from Care mode.
Select Camp from <icon>□</icon>."
"54f407b4","Once you start camping, you'll go to the bathroom and pack
your material right away."
"54f407b3","If you have five of the same material, that will get packed.
It still counts as five when you come back to the city."
"54f407b2","Then there are four things you can do in a tent."
"54f407b1","The Item and Sleep options are the same as for Care.
One good effect from sleeping is health restoration."
"54f407b0","The Rest option is nearly the same as using the Training
Hall's bed. You rest for one hour."
"54f407bf","The Cook option is probably the most important one.
Use the camp facilities to cook food."
"54f407be","What you make must be eaten right away.
You can only cook when your partners are hungry."
"53f405c4","Cooking is pretty easy. You use at least one ingredient you
have on hand, and then select from a list."
"53f405c5","When you are better at cooking, you can use two ingredients."
"53f405c6","Your partners will be happier eating your cooking instead of
plain ingredients. You really should cook for them."
"53f405c7","Oh, yeah, some advice...
Your tent has a Durability value..."
"53f405c0","If an enemy is near your camp site when you sleep or rest,
Durability will decrease."
"53f405c1","Make sure there's nothing dangerous nearby when you sleep or
rest."
"52f40450","A new tent?
I happen to be making one as we speak, but..."
"52f40453","I'm having a hard time getting the tools and materials I
need. Oh, yeah..."
"52f40452","If this shop reaches Grade 3, I'll probably be able to
finish it."
"52f40455","So you want a better tent...
Yeah, I can see that..."
"52f40454","If this shop reaches Grade 4, I'll probably be able to make
you one."
"52f40457","Hey, I just finished it.
This is a Premium Tent with improved Durability."
"52f40456","I'd love to just give it to you, but, hey, this is my
business we're talking about. It'll cost you 10,000 <icon>BIT</icon>."
"52f40459","I did it! I just finished it.
This is a Master Tent with much better Durability."
"52f40458","To be honest, this is an excellent item.
I can't let it go for less than 50,000 <icon>BIT</icon>."
"51f402fe","I'll buy it!
Let me think about it..."
"51f402ff","Okay, it's yours then!
I'll take care of the old tent."
"51f402fc","You got a Premium Tent (Valuable)!"
"51f402fd","You got a Master Tent (Valuable)!"
"51f402fa","No? Well, all right.
Come back if you decide you want it."
"51f402fb","You don't have enough money, do you?
Don't worry, I won't sell it to anyone else."
"51f402f8","I'll do my best to figure out how to make a better tent.
See you later."
"51f402f9","This is a true masterpiece, the ultimate...
You'll need to contribute your design skill, though!"
"4df3fcbb","Fine. Come back later."
"fe6a91e1","Hey, {0}.
I should say hello."
"fe6a91e0","I get claustrophobic, so wide-open places like this are
great. I'm always around here somewhere."
"fe6a91e3","I think there are lots. You'll find stuff like this just
running around."
"fe6a91e2","You got 300 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"fe6a91e5","There are lots of careless characters here, no?
Don't worry about it. Just take it."
"4bc8b8a","What an expanse! Makes me want to run around!"
"4bc8b8b","Oh, this? It's something I picked up somewhere."
"4bc8b88","You got {20} <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"4bc8b89","This is what they mean by ""many a mickle""! Ha ha ha!"
"9fb9a6e0","Hey, {0}! You're late!
I'm ready to go."
"9fb9a6e1","What am I doing?
Well, you can call me a ""Sender."""
"9fb9a6e2","I use my powers to quickly take you to areas you've already
been to."
"9fb9a6e3","Of course, it'll cost you.
Time is money. Don't they say that?"
"317196bb","I'm a Sender. Choose your destination."
"317196ba","Okay, we're on our way!
You ready?"
"317196b9","Yes
Never mind"
"317196b8","We're off then!"
"317196bf","No? That's a shame..."
"37074f03","You've come! I have awaited you, Master {0}!"
"37074f02","From now on, I shall heal wounds and illnesses here."
"37074f01","It shall be easy! What with this medical equipment and my
knowledge."
"37074f00","Well, I cannot do it for naught...
I have the expense of running this equipment..."
"c5ed62a8","Oh, my, a partner is ill! It shall take 1,000 <icon>BIT</icon>
and one hour to complete the cure."
"c5ed62a9","Oh, my, a partner is gravely wounded! It shall take
800 <icon>BIT</icon> and one hour to complete the healing."
"c5ed62aa","Oh, my, a partner is wounded! It shall take 300 <icon>BIT</icon>
and one hour to complete the healing."
"c5ed62ab","Your partner is exhausted... Recuperation shall take
100 <icon>BIT</icon> and one hour."
"c5ed62ac","There seems to be aught wrong with your partner.
You have taken excellent care of it."
"c5ed62ad","Please take care of my partner.
Never mind."
"c5ed62ae","I want my partner to recuperate.
Never mind."
"c5ed62af","Your partner is back to normal!
Much <icon>Fatigue</icon> has been relieved!"
"c5ed62a0","If something comes up, hasten back to me.
Ignore problems at your peril!"
"c5ed62a1","Much of your partner's <icon>Fatigue</icon> has been relieved!"
"c6ed641b","Come and rest when feeling fatigued.
Extreme exhaustion will only shorten your life."
"4bf07411","Oh, my, a partner is ill! It shall take 750 <icon>BIT</icon>
and one hour to complete the cure."
"4bf07410","Oh, my, a partner is gravely wounded! It shall take
600 <icon>BIT</icon> and one hour to complete the healing."
"4bf07413","Oh, my, a partner is wounded! It shall take 200 <icon>BIT</icon>
and one hour to complete the healing."
"4bf07412","Your partner is exhausted... Recuperation shall take
75 <icon>BIT</icon> and one hour."
"51f2bc1a","Oh, my, a partner is ill! It shall take 500 <icon>BIT</icon>
and one hour to complete the cure."
"51f2bc1b","Oh, my, a partner is gravely wounded! It shall take
400 <icon>BIT</icon> and one hour to complete the healing."
"51f2bc18","Oh, my, a partner is wounded! It shall take
100 <icon>BIT</icon> and one hour to complete the healing."
"51f2bc19","Your partner is exhausted... Recuperation shall take
50 <icon>BIT</icon> and one hour."
"beed57ab","Hmm... You've not enough money.
I cannot accept an IOU..."
"beed57aa","What? Are you all right?
I shall hope the condition doesn't worsen..."
"b16405a2","I WORK HERE."
"b16405a3","I MODIFY TRAINING GEAR!"
"b16405a0","USE GEAR A LOT. SAVE POWER. FIGHT HARD!"
"ac4f4019","I MODIFY TRAINING GEAR!"
"ac4f4018","STILL NOT ENOUGH POWER IN GEAR."
"ac4f401b","PLENTY OF POWER! CAN MODIFY TRAINING GEAR."
"ac4f401a","Your gear was modified. Level was increased!
Your gear is now more powerful!"
"ac4f401d","COME BACK ANYTIME."
"ac4f401c","ALL GEAR MAXED OUT!
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE I CAN DO."
"2cd4fb9d","Yum, this is too good!
Om nom nom..."
"2cd4fb9c","Oh, sorry, {0}!
I got lost in my food... "
"2cd4fb9f","I've decided to become a regular here!
More customers will come when they see me chow down, ha ha!"
"93c55d46","*cough* Yum, this is too good!
Oh, dear, there I go again!"
"93c55d47","I can't fit in a chair, so I'm making do here. Sorry if I'm
in the way..."
"93c55d44","Oh, no, that's no good. Your partners are hungry."
"93c55d45","And...it looks like you are out of cash now!
Okay, it's down to me..."
"93c55d42","Your partner is hungry."
"93c55d43","The food at this restaurant is great.
Let them eat, and be quick about it!"
"93c55d40","Your partner doesn't seem hungry."
"93c55d41","If they're ever hungry and you are low on funds...just come
on by!"
"881f027c","Hey, I'm gonna be in your debt! Whoa!"
"881f027d","I go out at night but if you see me during the day,
I'll give you a treat! Whoa!"
"19392177","See? Food for Training! Whoa!"
"19392176","You got Ginseng!"
"19392175","Come tomorrow before night falls! Whoa!
I'll be waiting."
"10391325","Hmm... You're inventory is super full!"
"e686ab2e","Huh. Were you looking for me?
Hehe, I've really fallen for this place..."
"e686ab2f","Look around. The view includes both city and prairie.
It's really amazing around dusk."
"e686ab2c","啊、說到這，你找到金甲龍獸了嗎？
星期五時會出現在伺服沙漠喔"
"e686ab2d","先不說這個…"
"60d34b45","Have a look! The scenery is amazing, right?
I'm gonna be a powerful Digimon and protect it!"
"60d34b44","ExVeemon shared his happiness with you!
Your partners' <icon>Mood</icon> went up!"
"60d34b47","The view's not bad right now but...you should really come
at dusk."
"60d34b46","I always admire a person who knows how to appreciate this
time of day."
"f6d79ed5","Like this here?
Hmm... I get it. Of course..."
"f6d79ed4","What's that? Oh, sorry, {0}.
I lose myself in my research so quickly."
"f6d79ed7","I'm looking for applications for energy refining technology
based on my research into Tamer power."
"f6d79ed6","I would love to study your body a little bit once you reach
a certain Tamer level."
"f6d79ed1","Let's start at level 20. Okay?"
"fbec647e","What's that? Has your Tamer level increased?"
"fbec647f","Wow, you're above level 20!
Let me take a scan right away!"
"fbec647c","Wow, you're above level 30!
Let me take a scan right away!"
"fbec647d","Wow, you're above level 40!
Incredible... Let me take a scan!"
"fbec647a","Wow, you've reached level 50!
Okay, let me take a scan!"
"fbec647b","What's that? No, your level isn't high enough yet.
Come back another time."
"fbec6478","Wow, look at this data! What miraculous power..."
"fbec6479","You've been very helpful.
Thank you for the incredible data."
"fbec6476","Take this!"
"fbec6477","You got two MP Chips!"
"fcec65d1","You got four MP Chips!"
"fcec65d0","You got six MP Chips!"
"fcec65d3","You got eight MP Chips!"
"fcec65d2","What's that? Your load is full?
Make some space and come back, okay?"
"fcec65d5","Well, I need to ask you something straight away..."
"fcec65d4","Next time, come back when you are at least level 30."
"fcec65d7","Next time, come back when you are at least level 40."
"fcec65d6","Next time, come back when you reach level 50."
"fcec65d9","Thank you for everything. Your data will help shape the
future of the city. I'm certain of it!"
"13757e1b","Oh, so you've come, {0}!"
"13757e1a","I've been making battle items, one after the next.
More than enough to sell."
"13757e19","So buy some!"
"25c2880","Have a look at my battle items!"
"25c2881","Buy
Sell
Exit"
"25c2882","See you soon!"
"7c778798","Oops, it's {0}.
You found me..."
"7c778799","I am working in a support role here for treasure hunters."
"7c77879a","You should have a better chance of finding something good.
Expect a bounty!"
"ee2f4533","I work to support Garudamon. You should have a 20% better
chance of finding something good."
"ee2f4532","Oh yeah. First let me tell you something good."
"ee2f4531","I am at my peak on Mondays. You'll be luckier if your
request falls on a Monday."
"ae32fd59","What do you think of this hospital, {0}?
The city needs a place like this."
"ae32fd58","I learned the art of medicine from Master Taomon."
"ae32fd5b","I'm really hoping that someone will bring a Digimon who
wants to become a doctor, though."
"ae32fd5a","How about it? Buy some medicine from me?"
"b484f762","You don't need any?"
"b484f763","Buy
Sell
Exit"
"b484f760","Well, I hope to see you again soon!"
"a6aa0dbe","{0}!
You're looking as happy as ever!"
"a6aa0dbf","I have been thinking about what I should do in the city...
I really like this district."
"a6aa0dbc","I thought I would go on patrol and keep an eye out for
anyone who would disturb the city's peace."
"a6aa0dbd","I know this place like the back of my hand.
Just relax and leave it to me!"
"a0581395","I've got my eye out for suspicious types. The city's wealth
is concentrated in this district."
"a0581394","I won't let anything bad happen on my watch!
That reminds me..."
"a0581397","I could tell you about how to prepare to live a serious
life... What do you think?"
"a0581396","<icon>躾け</icon> for both partners will increase if you listen...
How about it?"
"a0581391","Okay.
Not now, sorry."
"a0581390","You listened to GaoGamon! Your partners' <icon>躾け</icon> increased
by five!"
"a0581393","Okay, then, you heard me out! But you need to become even
more serious. Come again tomorrow!"
"a0581392","No? That's a shame..."
"a058139d","You really took heed today. See you tomorrow!"
"45c7fb8c","I shall reside here, {0}. No complaints?"
"45c7fb8d","Hmph. I never would have thought the city would get so big."
"45c7fb8e","I can research magic here... And the view is nice too.
That Taomon is a piece of work..."
"45c7fb8f","Oh, yeah... You should practice magic with me. Come by when
you feel up to it."
"d8bd1fc7","Practice your magic. Shall I use magic to fly you far away?"
"d8bd1fc6","My movement magic uses the power of the stars.
Your destination will depend on the day."
"d8bd1fc5","Today is Sunday. Your destination is...Server Desert."
"d8bd1fc4","Today is Monday. Your destination is...the Bony Resort."
"d8bd1fc3","Today is Tuesday. Your destination is...Logic Volcano."
"d8bd1fc2","Today is Wednesday. Your destination is...MOD Cape."
"d8bd1fc1","Today is Thursday. Your destination is...Absolute Zero."
"d8bd1fc0","Today is Friday. Your destination is...Faulty Ex Machina."
"d8bd1fcf","Today is Saturday. Your destination is...the Ohguino
Wastelands."
"d7bd1e55","回程你得自己想辦法喔。
如果沒有自動返航的話，最好先做好心理準備"
"d8bd1fce","No, thank you.
Okay, fly me there!"
"d7bd1e54","Hang on... Yeeeeooww!!!"
"cfbd11f5","No? How boring."
"26a4676d","You're late! How long did you expect to keep me waiting?!"
"26a4676c","And it was you who told me to come here, too... Humans!"
"26a4676f","Hmm? Oh, this apparatus... It's a device.
What do you think it is?"
"26a4676e","It had been buried here for eons. Why did it suddenly appear
now?"
"26a46769","I tried to figure it out, but it was impossible.
All I learned was..."
"26a46768","This door leads to a different dimension. Multiple
dimensions, even!"
"26a4676b","Hehe, that caught your interest! As I thought it would...
Of course, I'm very interested too!"
"26a4676a","I decided to take a trip to the ""beyond,"" but...I was forced
to return right away."
"26a46765","Maybe the device hadn't been running long enough since
restarting, but the dimensional paths are very unstable."
"26a46764","It seems I'll have to wait before I can travel to the
beyond. Maybe I could force my way through with more power."
"25a465fa","Hmph! Did I disappoint you? There's no rush. After all,
a different dimension means..."
"25a465fb","that it will likely be a different world than the real world
you humans call home."
"25a465f8","There might be nothing there, or it might be a hell where
unknown enemies are lurking."
"25a465f9","It could be someplace that needs someone fearless, or
someone weird, like me."
"25a465fe","Hehehe... You should come back if you think you're weird
enough..."
"bb8fa56","I'm not off to a different dimension yet. This thing is a
major pain in the butt."
"bb8fa57","Will you come with me?"
"bb8fa54","You came. Late, same as always."
"bb8fa55","The dimensional paths are newly stabilized. Or so it seems."
"bb8fa52","We can now go to Dimension M. That's what I'm saying."
"bb8fa53","We can now go to Dimension G. That's what I'm saying."
"bb8fa50","We can now go to Dimension T. That's what I'm saying."
"bb8fa51","We can now go to Dimension P. That's what I'm saying."
"bb8fa5e","We can now go to Dimension E. That's what I'm saying."
"bb8fa5f","We can now go to Dimension Z. That's what I'm saying."
"cb8fbc9","That thing took up residence right away. If you've got
business with it, go have a look."
"cb8fbc8","Oh, one more bit of advice. You will probably need to be on
your guard in the ""beyond."""
"cb8fbcb","Time flows differently there than it does here. You can only
stay over there for so long..."
"cb8fbca","When that time is up, you will be forcefully returned here."
"cb8fbcd","And once you enter, that dimensional path will become
unstable."
"cb8fbcc","It'll take some time before it stabilizes again. As in one
day of our world's time, to be specific."
"cb8fbcf","But that won't really matter if you are stronger than that
thing back there... Heh..."
"14b908a6","The path to that destination is not yet stabilized. If only
we knew someone with the power to stabilize it..."
"14b908a9","You've traveled that path once already today. It's
temporarily unstable. Wait until tomorrow."
"14b908a8","Come back again, then."
"8adb1ef2","There you are! You're late! Shoma and the others have
already left."
"8adb1ef1","Shoot... It seems that Diaboromon got in when I should have
been able to prevent it..."
"8adb1ef0","Diaboromon easily broke through the dimensional pathways and
went all the way inside."
"8adb1ef7","Go after him. The portal should still be open."
"8adb1ef6","Okay, I'm in!
I need to get ready. I'll be back."
"8adb1ef5","Take that thing down, hard! I'm asking you! "
"8adb1ef4","Hurry up then. Shoma is waiting for you, too."
"8adb1efb","You're going, then?"
"cb907ce9","Excellent, {0}! You came? You did!"
"cb907ce8","They call this the Entertainment District? Fascinating..."
"cb907ceb","Everyone needs to relax...but aren't you spending too much
time having fun?"
"cb907cea","So I decided to keep track of your victories in battle..."
"cb907ced","Are you aware of how well you've been doing? Why? Because
the V in Veedramon..."
"cb907cec","stands for victory!"
"cb907cef","I had it all figured it out, but what was it again?"
"cb907cee","Up to now, you've won...{20} times!"
"cb907ce1","I see. Not bad. I'll reward you every time you hit a certain
number of wins."
"cb907ce0","Come see me when you're confident of your number.
I'll be waiting!"
"ca907b76","啊、說到這，你找到金甲龍獸了嗎？
星期五時會出現在伺服沙漠喔"
"ca907b77","先不說這個…"
"5143dcb2","Hello there. Okay, let's count them up..."
"5143dcb3","Hi there, Vee{0}. I've got nothing more for
you...but I'll keep watching you."
"5143dcb0","No, sorry. It's too early to praise you yet."
"5143dcb1","More than 100? That's pretty good. Here, take this."
"5143dcb6","More than 300? Excellent. Here, take this."
"5143dcb7","More than 500? That's amazing. Here, take this."
"5143dcb4","More than 1,000? Whoa, great job! Here, take this."
"5143dcb5","You got Strength Chip x 2!"
"5143dcba","You got Strength Chip x 4!"
"5143dcbb","You got Strength Chip x 6!"
"5243de25","You got Strength Chip x 8!"
"5243de24","Go for 100 wins, to begin with. Okay, do your best!"
"5243de27","Hmm... Now go for 300 wins. Do your best!"
"5243de26","Hmm... Now go for 500 wins. Give it your all!"
"5243de21","Okay, my last challenge... Try 1,000 wins. Make it that far
and I'll have no complaints."
"5243de20","You made it to 1,000 wins at last...
You are really a Vee{0}!"
"5a43ea94","Hah?! You can't take it? Clear out your pack and come back."
"44604ce8","Hey, there, a new customer!"
"44604ce9","I'm here to exchange materials. You might learn something
new, too."
"44604cea","The options vary by the day. If you need liquids or wood,
leave it to me!"
"b6b76dc3","Do you wanna exchange something?"
"b6b76dc2","I'll exchange liquids on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays."
"b6b76dc1","I'll exchange wood on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays."
"b6b76dc0","I'll exchange premium liquids and woods on Sundays."
"b6b76dc7","That's one exchange. Do you have more?"
"f06ea14e","I can't breathe... *cough*"
"f06ea14f","Oh, {0}... As you can tell, I'm working hard."
"f06ea14c","What about you all? Atmosphere is everything here."
"6a1d7125","So...what do you think? It's good...and it's cheap..."
"6a1d7124","A pleasure doing business with you!"
"c09cfc65","Welcome... I'll call this place my Digivolution Dojo...
It's a dojo for Digivolution!"
"c09cfc64","How far along are your partners towards meeting the
conditions to Digivolve to the next generation?"
"c09cfc67","You don't know? No problem. I can figure out the
possibilities with one look."
"c09cfc66","There are four stages: FIX, HIGH, MID, and LOW."
"c09cfc61","FIX indicates that they're ready to Digivolve without a
doubt, but that state can sometimes change..."
"c09cfc60","That means that they could drop to a lower stage. It's a
good idea to check frequently."
"c09cfc63","When more than one partner is at FIX stage, the senior one
will take precedence."
"c09cfc62","But, yeah, that's about all I can do right now... With more
experts here..."
"c09cfc6d","We can increase the dojo's grade, enabling more options."
"c09cfc6c","If it's Digivolution you're after, then you need to work on
this dojo. I need your help."
"45b0f80e","Welcome... This is Digivolution Dojo!"
"45b0f80f","If you lose your way...come see me."
"46b0f9e0","嗯，那讓我來說明吧"
"46b0f9e3","預測圖最初會顯示R夥伴的情報，<icon>L</icon><icon>R</icon>按鈕，
可以切換想觀看進化情報的數碼寶貝。"
"46b0f9e2","接下來是「封鎖進化」的使用方法"
"3eb0ed00","If you lose your way...come see me."
"45b0f80c","{0}, we did it!
Digivolution Blocks are now possible!"
"45b0f80d","In the dojo's progress chart, place the cursor over the
Digimon whose Digivolution you want to stop. Press <icon>○</icon>."
"45b0f80a","Once that's done, that Digimon's Digivolution will stop.
Press again to undo this at any time."
"45b0f80b","Carefully control the Blocks to Digivolve to the Digimon
you want!"
"8c176b84","What do you think of this place, {0}?
I'll be selling the food I cook."
"8c176b85","We're starting small, but I'm certain we'll grow to become
a great restaurant someday."
"8c176b86","Try my cooking and see! Even Master Taomon praised it."
"ff0c5dbf","Welcome to my restaurant! Have some of my cooking while it's
hot!"
"ff0c5dbe","Come again soon!"
"36e88bea","Haha! I like this place!"
"36e88beb","There aren't many places where the soil is this good!
It feels good just to be here!"
"36e88be8","I want to feel this soil all over my body. In I go!"
"36e88be9","When I'm deep in the soil, you'll have to come looking for
me."
"36e88bee","I hope I can count on your support! I've got work to do!"
"b1352c01","Hahaha, you have a job for me? I bet you do!"
"b1352c00","I'm still looking around. Wait until tomorrow!"
"b1352c03","I just need to dig up some meat, right? See you tomorrow!"
"b1352c02","I just need to dig up some vegetables, right? See you

"b1352c05","Ah, the high-quality meat? I'm on it! See you tomorrow!"
"b1352c04","High-quality vegetables? I'm on it! See you tomorrow!"
"b1352c07","Haha! You came! What's this? No more room? Make some!"
"b1352c06","Haha, I dug some up. It's not great, though. Sorry!"
"b1352c09","Haha, I dug some up. It's pretty good! Take it and see!"

"1bbe0e02","What's that? You remembered? Okay. Anyway. My job..."
"1bbe0e03","I'll give you some Luck Coins to play with here, every day!"
"1bbe0e04","Hehe... Great, right? Don't make fun of me! Search real hard
and you might find some!"
"1bbe0e05","Anyway, here's today's coins..."
"1bbe0e06","You got 100 <icon>LUCK</icon>!"
"1bbe0e07","Well, if we find a lot, it's better to search for the one

"2cd7639a","You got {20} <icon>LUCK</icon>!"

"852249ba","You can now fish in the city, just like you would in the

"852249bb","Come and fish whenever you like. There aren't many types of
fish yet, though."
"f63c3613","This a fishing hole. This is just the first one. Have at it!"
"f63c3612","This a fishing hole. This is the second one. Go for it!"

"719ed1f4","Thinking about gathering nuts to sell. I'm good at gathering
nuts, you know?"
"719ed1f7","I can't get that many when it's just me, though. Watch
carefully."
"f88f65de","This is a nut shop... I can only sell one nut each day,
though."
"f88f65df","Buy
Sell
Exit"
"f88f65dc","Fine. Later, then."
"f18f5ad0","When we're sold out, we get more in the next day. Come back

"87b30217","Oh yeah! I've got something to tell you!"
"87b30216","That curse you got, <icon>呪い</icon>? I have a technique to reduce

<icon>機嫌</icon>, worse..."
"87b30214","So whaddaya think, interested?!"

what I'm doing here?"

"13d62603","Come by my place on Sundays!"
"ce65bb9","Did you check and see what day this is?"
"ce65bb8","There's no training bonus on Sundays. Kinda sucks, right?"
"ce65bbb","So I'm gonna pump you up! Yarrr!!!"
"ce65bba","It's Arresterdramon's special Sunday training!
Let's increase your partners' skills a little!"
"ce65bbd","Oh ho! You got it now? Checked to see if it's a Sunday?"

"cd30b28e","Tee hee! Come again soon!"
"7d4c6e35","Finally! I've been waiting for you!"
"7d4c6e34","Be happy, {0}. This is where DNA Digivolution
is possible."
"7d4c6e37","DNA Digivolution? It's a special form of Digivolution where
two Digimon become one."
"7d4c6e36","If it's a good combination, I can perform the DNA
Digivolution ceremony for you right here."
"7d4c6e31","You don't want your partners to merge? Yeah, that's a
typical reaction...but..."
"7d4c6e30","You seem to have strange powers. The two will remain even
even after DNA Digivolution."
"7d4c6e33","That said, one of the two will share powers during the
process and will end up with less after..."
"7d4c6e32","Simply put, one will revert to an earlier Digivolution
state."
"7d4c6e3d","It's not without risks. If you're okay with that, I'm ready
to perform the ceremony."
"2ffcd9e","I am the expert when it comes to DNA Digivolution."
"2ffcd9f","Farewell. Continue with your training."
"2ffcd9c","So you want to increase your dojo Grade... I might be able
to help you with that."
"2ffcd9d","Oh-ho, you should see your face right now!
Your partners can undergo the ceremony."
"2ffcd9a","Hmm... Unfortunately, your partners are not a combination
that can undergo DNA Digivolution."
"2ffcd9b","Well! Your partners can undergo Extra DNA Digivolution!"
"2ffcd98","The conditions are not met yet! Come back later!"
"2ffcd99","Listen up, {0}! I've got once-in-a-lifetime
good news!"
"2ffcd96","With the powers from this dojo, Extra DNA Digivolution is
possible!"
"2ffcd97","Extra DNA Digivolution has fewer risks than before.
That means..."
"3ffcf71","We can convert the power of the Digimon living in Floatia
to DNA Digivolution power!"
"3ffcf70","The ceremony can now be performed with a single Digimon.
Only one partner needs to be ready."
"3ffcf73","Of course, the other Digimon would still have to live here
in the city."
"3ffcf72","I'm so excited that I can provide you with Extra DNA
Digivolution services! So let's see..."
"3ffcf75","Which of your partners will be the one Digivolving?"
"3ffcf74","Never mind
Partner R {1}
Partner L {2}"
"3ffcf77","Let's get down to it, then!"
"3ffcf76","That's fine, then. It's not absolutely necessary."
"3ffcf79","We will need another Digimon for Extra DNA Digivolution.
Which would you like to use?"
"3ffcf78","{1} is ready for the ceremony.
What do you want to do?"
"ffcab8","{2} is ready for the ceremony.
What do you want to do?"
"ffcab9","Never mind
Extra DNA Digivolution for {1}"
"ffcaba","Never mind
Extra DNA Digivolution for {2}"
"66820019","Welcome to the prize exchange!"
"66820018","To begin, you'll need to get <icon>LUCK</icon> with a game

another Digimon is present."
"6682001a","I'll exchange all the <icon>LUCK</icon> you have for something
you really want. Good luck!"

"18ff6c59","Call upon me when you lose your way. I shall shed light on
the path to Digivolution."
"18ff6c5a","As an offering, I require but a few Digivolution items..."
"8bf45e73","I am Antylamon, master of knowledge!"
"8bf45e72","I shall impart upon you my wisdom, lost as you are."
"8bf45e71","What's this? Your partners' paths to all Digivolutions are
clear."
"8bf45e70","There remain some unclear Digivolution conditions for
{1}."
"8bf45e77","There remain some unclear Digivolution conditions for
{2}."
"8bf45e76","There remain some unclear Digivolution conditions for your
partners. Which would you like me to focus on?"
"8bf45e75","{1}
{2}"
"8bf45e74","Present an offering unto me. Without it, there shall be no
light upon your Digivolution."
"8bf45e7b","Here we go.... Grumbly grumbly hah!"
"92f46970","What! You have no Digivolution items? You lack training!"
"92f46971","Call upon me when you lose your way. Farewell."
"c257c1a","Hey, {0}! I decided to live here!"
"c257c1b","I will check your passion for Digivolution! At the speed of
sound!"
"8534e831","I am the master of speed, the Mach Warrior!"
"8534e830","Let me take a look... You have achieved Digivolution for
{20} type(s) of Digimon until now."
"8534e833","Not enough! Not enough at all! You must pursue Digivolution
at Mach speed! To become a master!"
"8534e832","Well done! Take this as a reward for 50 types of
Digivolution!"
"8534e835","You got 20,000 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"8534e834","Well done! Take this as a reward for 100 types of

Expert level in your pursuit of Digivolution..."
"8434e65c","Huh? No wonder you can't take any more rewards... You are
carrying too much."
"7c34d9e0","More training is needed. Come back when you reach 50 types."
"7c34d9e1","Not bad. Can you work a little harder? Come back when you
reach 100 types."
"7c34d9ee","Now you're getting the hang of it! Come back when you
reach 150 types."

"8e3bc37","Come and hang out whenever! It's a great place! Haha, ha!"
"83305c69","Haha, ha! You came to check up on me? Such a worrywart!"
"83305c68","It's more fun to be here than in the ice. I'm not doing
anything for a while."
"83305c6b","That reminds me. I like tough characters. Just for fun,
let me tell you your records."
"83305c6a","The highest HP for partners raised up to now is...{13}."
"83305c6d","The highest MP for partners raised up to now is...{14}."

"83305c61","The highest SPD for partners raised up to now is...{18}."
"83305c60","I thought I had something good for you, but you don't have
enough room. Come back later."
"82305af6","Hey, those are some impressive skills! Excellent! Take this!"
"82305af7","Hey, all your numbers are great! Incredible! Take this!"
"82305af4","What!? More than 50,000?! That's got me beat! Take this!"
"82305af5","What!? More than 5,000?! That's got me beat! Take this!"
"82305af2","They're all over 50,000 or 5,000? My hat's off to you!
You're something else, you are!"
"82305af3","You're formidable enough to frighten demons!
Here. Take this."
"82305af0","You got 2 Wisdom Chips!"
"82305af1","You got 4 Wisdom Chips!"
"82305afe","You got 6 Wisdom Chips!"
"82305aff","You got 8 Wisdom Chips!"
"81305903","Not bad, but not great either... Try adding another digit
to that number, okay?"
"81305902","Well, well... How far will you go? But you're still ready
for more? That's amazing!"
"81305901","I give up already! There's nothing more I can give you if
you go any higher!"
"5578cd13","Who is it? Whoops, it's {0}. Sorry about that!"
"5578cd12","Ever since my brainpower got an Apparatus enhancement,
my research has benefitted immensely!"
"5578cd11","What research, you say? It's all about...eternal life!"
"5578cd10","We mechanical Digimon have not been blessed with
immortality...yet."
"5578cd17","I keep researching ways to extend our lives, if even by a
little."
"5578cd16","Come see me when your partners are getting old. I might be
able to help."
"e45ee0b8","How old are they? This Apparatus will check their data."
"e45ee0b9","Huh, older than 15 years? Impressive. This is good data.
Take this."
"e45ee0ba","Wow, older than 20 years? Very impressive. This is great
data. Take this."
"e45ee0bb","Whoa, older than 30 years? Amazing data! Take this."
"e45ee0bc","What? Older than 40 years? Unbelievable data! Take this."
"e45ee0bd","Once I get some good, recent data, I'll give you a helpful
item. Come back soon!"
"e45ee0bf","You can't take any more items. Make some room and come back."
"e45ee0b0","You got a Dirumpimpetice!"
"e45ee0b1","You got a Parvularmice!"
"dd5ed5b3","You got a Ferrumachinice!"
"e55ee22b","You got a Tormentilupine!"
"ea6128a1","You got a Machinimarine!"
"e55ee22a","You got a Hebetimpetine!"
"e96126ce","You got an Infinitine!"
"e55ee229","I see. That's good, but it's not great data... Let's see
what it's like after 15 years."
"e55ee228","Okay, do you want to aim for 20 years? Thanks."
"e55ee22f","Now, do you want to aim for 30 years? Please."
"e55ee22e","I don't know if you can do this but...could you try to get
past 40 years? Here's hoping!"
"e55ee22d","That's shocking data! That's good for now. Thank you for all
your help."
"e55ee22c","You can read past data from the Digivice. I'll check the
records. Okay, here goes."
"e55ee223","Hmm... The results indicate a peak of {20} years."
"6b07de8c","{0}! This is glorious!"
"6b07de8d","I don't want to intrude, so I've been roaming around
outside."
"6b07de8e","Children run away crying, though... I must have been pretty
frightening..."
"fdfd02c7","There are things like ghosts and Shiki in the human world,
it seems."
"fdfd02c6","They're really frightening? I'd never go where they were."
"fdfd02c5","{1} looks at SkullGreymon with fear..."
"fdfd02c4","{1} can bear to look at SkullGreymon now."
"fdfd02c3","{2} looks at SkullGreymon with fear..."
"fdfd02c2","{2} can bear to look at SkullGreymon now."
"fdfd02c1","That was mental training! Everything's gone up a little:
HP, MP, strength, and stamina!"
"cbe9f0be","If I just...hmm...like this? Oof..."
"cbe9f0bf","What? What do you know! It's {0}.
This is research, you know. Research."
"cbe9f0bc","It seems, though, that I've hit a little dead end. Would you
mind giving me a hand?"
"cbe9f0bd","This is for the future of the city!"
"c597f695","You'll help me? Okay, what I need now for my research is..."
"c597f694","Take one of your partner Digimon, get them to In-Training I,
and then bring them back."
"c597f697","Bring one of your partner Digimon back here with an injury."
"c597f696","Take one of your partner Digimon, get them to Nature: Filth,
and then bring them back."
"c597f691","Bring one of your partner Digimon back here with an illness."
"c597f690","Take one of your partner Digimon, get them above 80 G,
and then bring them back."
"c597f693","Take one of your partner Digimon, get them to less than 1
<icon>躾け</icon>, and then bring them back."
"c597f692","Bring one of your partner Digimon when they are exactly 15."
"c597f69d","Take one of your partner Digimon, get them to Mega, and then
bring them back."
"c597f69c","Take one of your partner Digimon, get them above 10
<icon>呪い</icon>, and then bring them back."
"c497f522","Take one of your partner Digimon, and bring them back at
maximum Bond, DigiFriend, and <icon>機嫌</icon>."
"c497f523","Okay? Go for it. I'll be very grateful!"
"c497f520","Ah... a Digimon that meets the conditions! Thank you..."
"c497f521","Okay, I got the data! I can get back to my research!"
"c497f526","Thank you. This is a token of my gratitude."
"c497f527","You got 10,000 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"c497f524","Okay, then. Until next time."
"23aa74e1","Hey, {0}! Have you been fighting hard at
the Colosseum?"
"23aa74e0","I would be really proud of you if you made it to Champion!"
"23aa74e3","After a lot of thought, I've decided to open an item shop!"
"23aa74e2","This will make battling in the Colosseum really convenient.
I hope to see you around here a lot!"
"23aa74e5","{0}! You came over! Well... I guess I was the
one who came over..."
"23aa74e4","They're planning to build a Colosseum here..."
"23aa74e7","But the system isn't working yet. Even I don't understand
why..."
"23aa74e6","You should make sure you're ready when it is open. I've been
getting stock in ready for when it is."
"23aa74e9","Make sure you visit me when you're in the area."
"29fc6e8a","This is my item shop! What sort of items can you bring in?"
"29fc6e8b","Buy
Sell
Exit"
"29fc6e88","Are you here to buy some items?"
"22fc638c","Come and visit whenever!"
"5c473203","You didn't waste any time coming to see me,
{0}. I know why just by looking at your face."
"5c473202","The fishing is really great here. But you won't find the top
ranking fish."
"5c473201","Those are very difficult to breed and farm. However... "
"5c473200","With my farming skills, there is nothing that is impossible."
"eb2d45a8","When the Fishing Hole grade is four or higher, I will show
you the true awesomeness of my farming skills."
"eb2d45a9","Bring me 2 Digituna."
"eb2d45aa","Bring me 2 Digisnakeheads."
"eb2d45ab","If you do that, you'll be able to fish for Digituna in
Fishing Hole #4."
"eb2d45ac","If you do that, you'll be able to fish for Digisnakehead in
Fishing Hole #5."
"eb2d45ad","You brought them. Good!"
"eb2d45ae","Nghh...!"
"eb2d45af","This is good. Now you can catch Digituna in Fishing Hole #4!"
"eb2d45a0","This is good. Now you can catch Digisnakehead in Fishing
Hole #5!"
"eb2d45a1","Fishing Hole #4 has already raised Digituna."
"ec2d471b","Fishing Hole #5 has already raised Digisnakehead."
"ec2d471a","There's nothing more I can do. Now go and enjoy the kingly
sport of fishing!"
"d6a3e8a2","I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME WORKING TOGETHER."
"d6a3e8a3","THIS MAY BE USEFUL FOR SOMETHING."
"d18f2319","I PLOW THE FIELDS."
"d18f2318","I ASK FOR RECOVER ITEMS IN RETURN."
"d18f231b","Choose item to give
Don't give an item"
"d18f231a","WHICH WILL YOU GIVE? I CANNOT ACCEPT ITEMS OF HIGH VALUE."
"d18f231d","EXCELLENT. THANK YOU."
"d18f231c","Okuwamon plowed a field! Your field has improved!"
"d88f2e18","OH? NO RECOVERY ITEMS? WHAT A SHAME."
"d88f2e19","SORRY. I CANNOT ACCEPT THIS."
"d88f2e16","SORRY BUT THIS FIELD IS ALREADY PERFECT."
"d88f2e17","BRING RECOVERY ITEMS WHENEVER."
"633304fd","The antivirus pro-gram research is going well! I think you
can expect great-things!"
"633304fc","I have become great-ly interested in what a Tamer is since
meeting you."
"633304ff","I am particularly interested in Tamer-skills! I think my
research will greatly-benefit you!"
"633304fe","{0}! I've-done-it!"
"633304f9","I have developed a method of resetting acquired Tamer skills
and returning TP!"
"633304f8","However, I haven't completed the testing stage... The
procedure will only succeed once..."
"633304fb","I want to do fur-ther research so the procedure can be
per-formed mul-tiple times."
"633304fa","So, do you want to reset your Tamer skills?"
"633304f5","I don't want to reset my skills
I want to reset my skills"
"633304f4","Oh... It looks like you are carrying too much. Please reduce
the number of things you are carrying to 20."
"6233030a","Under-stood! Here I go!"
"6233030b","{0}'s Tamer skills have been completely reset!
All your TP has been returned to you."
"62330308","It looks like it was-a-suc-cess! Please check for yourself."
"62330309","I am testing my skill-reset tech-nology."
"6233030e","The research I am con-ducting will allow me to reset your
skills. Please-be-patient."
"6233030f","I finally did it! It is now pos-si-ble to reset your skills
as often as you like!"
"6233030c","There is only one problem... It requires a lot of e-ner-gy."
"6233030d","It re-quires a lot of <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"62330302","10,000 <icon>BIT</icon> each time... What do you want-to-do?"
"62330303","I'm ve-ry sor-ry... You don't have enough <icon>BIT</icon>."
"5a32f69b","You don't want to pro-ceed. I understand."
"ccb9339c","ANYTHING FUN AHEAD?"
"ccb9339d","TELL ME..."
"396c4196","Heh heh! You came at a great time!"
"396c4197","I am opening a business in this town. What kind of business,
you ask?"
"396c4194","I have a large stock of decorations and vases to make this
town splendid!"
"396c4195","You don't look interested?! But, sir, you are wrong!"
"396c4192","There is a limit to my funds. I will give you a market
discount!"
"396c4193","Production and procurement are not stable. Because they're
luxury items and you don't really need them."
"396c4190","So you should buy lots when they're cheap. Then, when their
price is high, sell them!"
"396c4191","The town can become splendid and you can make some money.
That can't be a bad thing!"
"396c419e","I'm starting small at the moment but I have BIG plans."
"396c419f","I hope I can count on your support!"
"531a7a2d","Heh! You want to know about the market? This is what I'm
buying now."
"531a7a2c","I'll be back tomorrow!"
"e0a67bb1","Hi there. You look in good spirits."
"e0a67bb0","I am working here. I'm not messing around."
"67970f9a","Do you want to try my Triple Roll dice game? It's only
300 <icon>LUCK</icon>!"
"67970f9b","I'll play!
I don't want to play.
What are the rules?"
"67970f98","Your pet doesn't have 300 <icon>LUCK</icon> so you will need
3,000 <icon>BIT</icon> which you do have."
"67970f99","Your pet doesn't have 300 <icon>LUCK</icon> so you will need
3,000 <icon>BIT</icon> which you don't have."
"67970f9e","That's a shame. Come back soon."
"67970f9f","First we both roll two dice (six-sided)."
"67970f9c","I then get to roll one again."
"67970f9d","You then get to roll one again."
"67970f92","Three dice are rolled at the same time. The digits are
totaled, and the largest total wins."
"67970f93","However, there are some exceptions. If your total is 15 or
greater, you lose."
"6897110d","If all three of your dice have the same number, this is
called a repdigit and you win!"
"6897110c","If both players get repdigits, then the larger repdigit
wins."
"6897110f","If we have the same repdigits, you win. But if we both have
a total of 15 or over, it's a draw."
"6897110e","Those are the rules. So, do you want to play?"
"68971109","Let's get started! Ready to roll!"
"68971108","I got...<color=#db7093ff>{13} and {14}</color>, for a total of <color=#db7093ff>{16}</color>.
You got <color=#00ffffff>{17} and {18}</color>, for a total of <color=#00ffffff>{20}</color>."
"6897110b","Hmm... I won't roll again."
"6897110a","I see... I will roll again."
"68971105","<color=#db7093ff>{13} + {14} = {16}. Additional roll</color> against <color=#00ffffff>{17} + {18} = {20}</color>.
What do you want to do?"
"68971104","<color=#db7093ff>{13} + {14} = {16}. No additional roll</color> against <color=#00ffffff>{17} + {18} = {20}</color>.
What do you want to do?"
"65970cb4","Take an additional roll
Don't take an additional roll"
"65970cb5","Okay! Let's see..."
"65970cb6","I got...<color=#db7093ff>{13}, {14}, and {15}</color>, for a total of <color=#db7093ff>{16}</color>.
You got <color=#00ffffff>{17}, {18}, and {19}</color>, for a total of <color=#00ffffff>{20}</color>."
"65970cb7","I got...<color=#db7093ff>{13} and {14}</color>, for a total of <color=#db7093ff>{16}</color>.
You got <color=#00ffffff>{17}, {18}, and {19}</color>, for a total of <color=#00ffffff>{20}</color>."
"65970cb0","I got...<color=#db7093ff>{13}, {14}, and {15}</color>, for a total of <color=#db7093ff>{16}</color>.
You got <color=#00ffffff>{17} and {18}</color>, for a total of <color=#00ffffff>{20}</color>."
"65970cb1","Yes! I got a repdigit! I win!"
"65970cb2","Ugh... You got a repdigit. You win..."
"65970cb3","We both got repdigits...but mine is bigger, so I win."
"65970cbc","We both got repdigits...but yours is bigger, so you win."
"65970cbd","Neither of us got repdigits, but I got the bigger total,
so I win."
"66970e27","Neither of us got repdigits, but you got the bigger total,
so you win."
"66970e26","I got over 14. I lose..."
"66970e25","You got over 14. You lose..."
"66970e24","We both got over 14, so it's a draw."
"5f97032a","Well that means I lose. It's a tough game..."
"5f97032b","You got 300 <icon>LUCK</icon>!"
"60970492","Unfortunately, you lose this time. It's my win today."
"6097049d","You lost 3,000 <icon>BIT</icon>..."
"6097049c","You lost 300 <icon>LUCK</icon>..."
"8551c680","You... Ugh... Never mind..."
"8551c681","I feel like I had a Tamer before..."
"d6cc175a","{0}...This is so exciting!
I never thought we'd see a battle in the town."
"d6cc175b","I want to see even more exciting battles in the Colosseum!
Keep on winning!"
"d6cc1758","Raising rank is important, but true warriors continue to
fight regardless."
"5118b7f1","{0}...This is so exciting!
I never thought we'd see a battle in the town."
"5118b7f0","Wow! I don't know what to say. You got 100 victories."
"5118b7f3","That's impressive! You got 75 victories."
"5118b7f2","Great job! You got 50 victories."
"5118b7f5","Not bad. You got 25 victories."
"5118b7f4","The victories warriors gain in this Colosseum are a badge of
honor. You currently have {20} victories."
"5118b7f7","You got a Fortidracine!"
"5118b7f6","You got a Lanceaesquetrine!"
"5118b7f9","You got a Solluxine!"
"5118b7f8","You got a Salicelerine!"
"5018b61e","Why don't you try for 25 victories? That's a great first
step."
"5018b61f","Next try for 50 victories! I'm sure you can do it!"
"5018b61c","Now aim for 75 victories! I bet you can't wait to get
fighting!"
"5018b61d","Now you can try for 100 victories! This is the last goal!
It would be a splendid achievement!"
"5018b61a","You really did it! I wasn't sure if 100 victories was really
possible, but I guess anything is possible for you!"
"5018b61b","I want to give you something but you don't seem to have
any room in your inventory."
"164cd798","Hey! You came, {0}!"
"164cd799","You weren't expecting me here? Well, this is a great place
for doing research on Digimon."
"164cd79a","A Digimon always needs to be trained and ready to fight.
That's what a Mega is."
"88049533","Are you communicating with your partner? I will check now to
see how many times you have communicated."
"88049532","You've communicated over 50 times! That's pretty good.
Here, take this."
"88049531","Wow! You've communicated over 100 times! That's great! Here,
take this."
"88049530","Impressive! You've communicated over 200 times. Here, take
this."
"88049537","Wow! You've communicated over 300 times! That's great! Here,
take this."
"88049536","Depending on the number of times you've communicated, I'll
give you some useful items, so make sure you check back!"
"88049534","You're carrying too much. Make some space so you can take
your reward..."
"8804953b","You got 1 Rotting Melon!"
"8804953a","You got 2 Rotting Melons!"
"87049340","You got 3 Rotting Melons!"
"87049341","You got 5 Rotting Melons!"
"87049342","Hmm... It's not bad. You've communicated over 50 times, but
I think you can do better."
"87049343","Your next goal is 100 times. Keep up the good communication!"
"87049344","Your next goal is 200 times. Keep up the good communication!"
"87049345","Your next goal is 300 times. Keep up the good communication!"
"87049346","You really are a master of communication! There is no
further advice I can offer you."
"87049347","It's almost like going back in time... It's a great machine,
don't you think? Let's go!"
"87049348","The survey is complete. You have communicated...{20} times!"
"407f5dbe","{0}. Good to see you."
"407f5dbf","I'm researching skills. I wondered if you'd let me analyze
your attack skills."
"407f5dbc","I'll compensate you depending on the number of skills you
have. Thanks for helping with my research!"
"3a2d6395","Okay. I'll start the analysis..."
"3a2d6394","You've learned 30 types of skills... That's really
something."
"3a2d6397","You've learned 40 types of skills... This is going to be
great for my work."
"3a2d6396","Wow! You've learned over 50 types of skills!"
"3a2d6391","This is over 60 types of skills! I can't believe it! I'm so
grateful to you!"
"3a2d6390","See you later! Keep up the good work!"
"3a2d6393","Thank you! My analysis is complete. Here is your
compensation."
"3a2d6392","You're carrying too many things. I'm afraid you need to
store some of your items."
"3a2d639d","You got 2 Stamina Chips!"
"3a2d639c","You got 4 Stamina Chips!"
"392d6222","You got 6 Stamina Chips!"
"392d6223","You got 8 Stamina Chips!"
"392d6220","Hmm... This isn't enough data... I really wanted to compare
at least 30 different skills..."
"392d6221","Come back and see me when you have over 40 different skills.
Thank you!"
"392d6226","Come back and see me when you have over 50 different skills.
Thanks in advance!"
"392d6227","I'd really like to compare 60 skills next time... I know
that's a difficult number to achieve but you can do it!"
"392d6224","Thanks to you, I got the data I need. Much appreciated!"
"b09a574","I was looking for something beautiful and then I realized
it was here all along..."
"b09a575","Is there anything more beautiful in this world than a
DigiCard? I will reward anyone who agrees with me."
"b09a576","We need to work hard to reestablish culture in this town!
I will do what is within my abilities, too."
"fc22c86f","Did you find something new to add to your DigiCard
collection?"
"fc22c86e","Your DigiCard collection has over 100 cards! Here's your
reward..."
"fc22c86d","Your DigiCard collection has over 200 cards! Please accept
this."
"fc22c86c","Your DigiCard collection has over 300 cards! Here is my
thank you."
"fc22c86b","Your DigiCard collection has over 400 cards! This is to
commend your efforts."
"fc22c86a","Your DigiCard collection has over 500 cards! This is your
final gift."
"fc22c869","You got a Phoenixine!"
"fc22c868","You got 2 HP Chips!"
"fc22c867","You got 4 HP Chips!"
"fc22c866","You got 6 HP Chips!"

"fb22c6fd","100 cards is your first goal. When you've achieved that,
come to me for your reward."
"fb22c6fe","Next goal is 200 cards! When you've achieved that, come to
me for your reward."
"fb22c6ff","Now you need to get 300 cards! I have a reward for you when

luxury to be able to fish in town?"

"f7862db3","You should come by when you don't have any fish."
"7e76c19a","Oh! Welcome! I have something for you!"
"7e76c19b","I'll take all the fish you have first, then we can talk!"
"7e76c198","Let me explain my training method to you."
"7e76c199","You will need to fish three Black Digitrout."
"7e76c19e","But in that time you can't leave the area or load data."
"7e76c19f","Of course, food and portable toilets etc. are your own
responsibility."

for you if you succeed."

I just need to get ready..."

talk to me."
"7e76c193","Preparations... You are a serious fisher..."

up, just leave the area."
"7f76c30c","Good job! You caught three Black Digitrout."
"7f76c30f","Here...please take this!"
"7f76c30e","You got a Good Fishing Rod!"
"7f76c309","You're more likely to catch a fish, or even multiple fish,
with this rod. It's my favorite. Please look after it."
"7776b69c","I have nothing left to teach you. Haha! All of the fish of
the world are in the palm of your hand!"

you think?"
"d7ed4269","It would be really bad if the warehouse was attacked by
by the enemy..."
"d7ed4268","But you don't need to worry about that while I'm here!"
"d7ed426f","You can be rest assured that any items stored in this
warehouse will be available when you need them."

"25ecbb84","You came at just the right time, {0}.
I've just finished my preparations."

"5f2749e4","I will tell you when you've become a champion."
"7a12b6fd","There are much stronger opponents out there than myself.
The world is so big and you are so young."
"7a12b6fc","You are totally dominating! You are a true champion!"
"7a12b6ff","You have cleared 60. Just a little further and you'll be a
world champion."
"7a12b6fe","You have cleared 50. That's good going, but don't slack now."
"7a12b6f9","You have cleared 40, but you still have a way to go until
you can be called a champion."
"7a12b6f8","I will acknowledge you as a champion depending on how many
you clear."
"7a12b6fb","You got 2 Speed Chips!"
"7a12b6fa","You got 4 Speed Chips!"
"7a12b6f5","You got 6 Speed Chips!"
"7a12b6f4","You got 8 Speed Chips!"
"7912b50a","Hmm... First try and clear 40. I'm sure you can manage that."
"7912b50b","Your next target is clearing at least 50. Then you'll be
well on your way to being a champion."
"7912b508","Your next target is clearing at least 60. You have to keep
up the hard work and not slack."
"7912b509","Now you just need to clear all of them. Only then will I
acknowledge you as a true champion."
"7912b50e","Champion...when I looked into your eyes...I always knew the
answer on that day you asked the question."
"7912b50f","I want to give you something, but you don't seem to have any
room in your inventory."

hurt anyone."

sleep in the light."

dimension..."
"ebb36e39","Come and see me. I will give you a reward."
"ebb36e3e","I see... You've been to another dimension... But you don't
have enough phase particles for me."
"ebb36e3f","You've made a few trips to other dimensions."
"ebb36e3c","You go to other dimensions often."
"ebb36e3d","You go to other dimensions a lot!"
"ebb36e32","Wow! I can't believe how often you take trips to other
dimensions! "

in the ground, a long time ago."
"11d80a66","I wonder if it could have something to do with the Demon
World that we Deadly Digimon lost..."
"11d80a67","If it is...something nasty might come out of it..."
"11d80a60","I have decided to stay here and monitor it, just in case.
I hope it turns out that I had nothing to worry about..."
"82f1f6df","I have been called one of the Seven Deadly Digimon...
but I am also my own Digimon."
