"637c5052","What is this place?"
"627c4eff","It's pitch black! I can't see a thing!"
"617c4d0c","I'm scared... {0}! Hold my hand!"
"607c4b99","..."
"5f7c4a26","Hey! That's MY hand, {0}!"
"5e7c48b3","No fair, Himari!"
"5d7c46c0","Goodness, what noise."
"6c7c5ebd","Who're you?!"
"6b7c5cca","Pleased to meet you."
"5e7a09dc","My name is Mirei Mikagura."
"5f7a0b4f","A human?! You saved us, didn't you! So, um..."
"607a0d22","We don't have time to chat right now. Let me just tell you
the most important parts."
"617a0e95","What attacked you just now was the entity known as the
Enforcer."
"5a7a0390","What? That monster was the Enforcer?!"
"5b7a0503","It's under the influence of the ""Brain Hack Program."""
"5c7a06f6","Brain Hack...? Is that what it sounds like?"
"5d7a0869","Yes. The BH Program is a virus that illegally hacks into
a Digimon's ""brain"", so to speak, and alters its behavior."
"667a16b4","Those infected by the BH Program exhibit a few typical
symptoms:"
"677a1827","Memory damage, disturbed consciousness, collapse of the ego,
sudden violent tendencies..."
"f081abb7","Now I see. My partner must have been infected, too..."
"ef81a9c4","So? Who's responsible for this? Who'd write a program that
could hack into the world's self-purification function?"
"f281ae9d","The only one who can determine that is {0}.
You all came from the real world, so..."
"f181ad2a","Time's up. Tell this world's Digimon about what we've said.
It may be some time before I can speak to you again."
"ec81a50b","Till next time, then."
"eb81a398","Huh. So, I guess...she helped us? I was positive we were
done for."
"ee81a851","Her name was Mirei, right? What do you think her deal is?
She seems to know a whole lot, but...think can we trust her?"
"ed81a6fe","I couldn't say, but right now, we've got no other leads.
We've got to warn the Digimon about the BH Program."
"e8819edf","All right, I'm going into town too. I haven't said hello to
this world's Jijimon yet."
"e7819d6c","Hey, wait! I don't trust you yet either! Wait up!"
"6a7e99ce","Whoa, Mameo's faaast!"
"68d77edf","We heard everything from Mr. Mameo, {0}."
"69d780b2","Including my self-introduction, and the explanation of why
I'm innocent."
"6ad78225","So, {0}, now that you're here, let's get to the
topic at hand."
"63d77720","Hmm..."
"64d77893","If this Mirei is to be believed, the BH Program would seem
to be the root of our troubles."
"65d77a06","Those Digimon being altered into Machinedramon, and..."
"66d77bf9","Omegamon Zwart D (Defeat)...the Enforcer. To think that even
he's been infected..."
"6fd789c4","Omegamon Zwart D, huh? Wonder if he'll end up turning into a
Machinedramon, too."
"70d78bb7","Any thoughts as to how the user behind the BH Program could
have disseminated it?"
"6dd9c555","...Not a one."
"6cd9c3e2","Nothing?!"
"6bd9c20f","Still, if someone made this virus, there ought to be a way
of making an antivirus program to counter it."
"6ad9c09c","Of course, discovering the hacker behind the BH Program
would be a great step forward as well."
"69d9bf29","Guess that's gonna be our job, right, {0}?"
"68d9bdb6","This Mirei lady said you'd meet her again, didn't she? I've
got a few things I'd like to ask her."
"67d9bbc3","We'll speed up our plan to develop an antivirus program. Mr.
Mameo, might I ask you to tell us more about Machinedramon?"
"66d9ba50","Mm, all right. That's easy enough."
"75d9d1cd","Hmm... I guess we made a little progress, right? We should
get back to work. Gotta feed Rikka and the others, too!"
"74d9d05a","Hey, {0}... Did you get the feeling that Mirei
what's-her-face knew us somehow?"
"73dc0d5e","True that! She was calling you by name, {0}.
She didn't recognize me or Kouta right away, though."
"74dc0f31","Why did the three of us get pulled into this world, anyway?
Maybe it has to do with that tournament back then after all."
"71dc0a78","But Mameo wasn't Shoma Tsuzuki, after all...
Maybe it was just a coincidence?"
"72dc0beb","I wonder... Let's ask next time we see him."
"77dc138a","Shoma...Tsuzuki? It couldn't be."
"9daa64","Here we go, {0}."
"39daf3d","I came up with a general outline of how things will go, and
wanted to give you a rundown."
"29dad4a","That Mirei woman still hasn't reappeared, and it looks like
analyzing the BH Program will take a good long while."
"fd9da5ab","We'll need to gather a whole lot of different data to code
an antivirus program, too, and that'll take some work."
"fc9da438","So we've decided that your job will be finding helping hands
and protecting the Digimon that aren't affected."
"ff9da8f1","I've told Kouta and Himari the news by DigiMail."
"fe9da71e","I would've liked to just tell you by DigiMail too, but I've
actually got something to discuss with you, just between us."
"f99d9f7f","?"
"f89d9d8c","I want to give you this. I know it might be a bother, but
just do me a favor and take it."
"fb9b63ee","You got a Prototype Antivirus Program from Mameo."
"fc9b6541","It's a prototype antivirus program I made based on my own
research. You might've had a glimpse of it earlier."
"f99b6088","I tried injecting it into a Digimon that was about to be
altered, so it wouldn't become a Machinedramon, but..."
"fa9b627b","While it did slow down the process, it couldn't stop the
transformation completely."
"ff9b6a1a","But hey, at least it showed some results."
"9b6b8d","..."
"fd9b6734","Why would you give me this?
This is kinda shady...
You're pretty dedicated, aren't you?"
"fe9b68a7","Cause I like you. No, not really."
"f39b5776","Don't trust me yet, huh? Well, listen."
"f49b58e9","Yeah, just call me Mr. Serious. You're sure calm about this,
aren't you?"
"f5991be5","This will disappear if it's copied, and I only made one. So
I wanted to deliver it by hand."
"f4991a72","I thought about giving it to Jijimon and Taomon for
reference, obviously, but..."
"f399189f","Since you're going to be out of town the most, I figured it
was most likely to be helpful to you. Just a guess."
"f299172c","I've got something I want to look into on my own, too. So
I'll let you know if I find anything useful. Later."
"ca599e91","C'mon, Kouta! Fight fight fight!"
"c75999d8","That's right! We fall down, and we get back up again. As
long as you don't give up, the road will open up before you."
"c8599b4b","That's good to hear, but {0} and Himari got
here at the same time, and look how far ahead they are..."
"c8599b4a","That's good to hear, but...it sure looks from here like I'm
the only one getting left behind."
"cd59a36a","It sure looks from here like I'm the only one getting left
behind."
"ce59a4dd","They say slow and steady wins the race, Kouta. Hurrying
won't get us anywhere."
"cb59a004","Yeah, but they say he who hesitates is lost, too. Especially
at a time like this."
"cc59a1f7","If this is all I can do, I'm just a burden on them."
"c1599046","I can't do ANYTHING. You're helpful, Kouta!"
"c2599239","Exactly. You're doing something that the Digital World truly
needs in order to be saved, Kouta."
"cf5be527","Well...thanks, you two. But, and I'm sorry to ask...could
you leave me alone for a while?"
"ce5be3b4","Kouta's making it so Yukimura can't Digivolve. He says
he's weak!"
"d15be80d","It's not Kouta's fault. I'm just a coward, and I can't seem
to figure out what I should do..."
"d05be69a","Don't YOU get all down too, Yukimura!"
"cb5bdefb","Ah, you're right. This is exactly the time when I need to
support Kouta the most."
"ca5bdd08","It's okay, {0}! Leave Kouta to us!"
"9cac000e","Swing and a miss...again."
"9babfe9b","As far as I can tell, we've tried just about every piece of
transmission equipment now."
"9aabfd28","I think we've gone about everywhere we could, except for the
places we couldn't get into."
"a1ac082d","I guess there's really no way to get in touch with the real
world after all."
"a0ac06ba","Look, Himari, just tell me already. Why do you want to
contact the real world so badly?"
"9fac04c7","Well, that's..."
"9eac0354","Oh, there you are, {0}. How's it going on your
end? Finding some residents for town?"
"95abf509","Hmm... Yeah, we're working to save the Digital World, aren't
we."
"94abf396","Hey, {0}...do you ever want to go back home to
the real world?"
"97a9b9f8","..."
"98a9bb6b","Of course I want to.
Eventually, I guess.
This place might actually work better for me."
"9ff73c74","Of course I want to.
Sure, eventually.
I think this place may actually suit me better."
"99a9bcde","Yeah! Right? Anyone would!"
"9aa9beb1","Whoa, you're sure calm about it! I'm jealous."
"9ba9c024","What?! I... That's..."
"9ca9c197","Never mind. Forget it. Talking about that now won't solve
anything."
"9da9c30a","We'll never be able to patch up these network outages if we
don't find out about the BH Program and move forward, I bet."
"9ea9c4fd","I understand. I get it, I really do..."
"8fa9ad00","Let's take a break, Himari. You seem pretty worn out."
"90a9aef3","Yeah...thanks. Not that our bodies can get tired in this
world, but..."
"9b12933","I think I'm kind of emotionally exhausted. I could use a
little change of pace. See ya later, {0}."
"4538a7fb","Just cut it out already!"
"4638a96e","Himari, calm down, would you?"
"4738aac1","Don't you tell me to calm down! Look around. Everything just
keeps getting worse!"
"4838acb4","Himari. Taking it out on Jijimon won't help anything. It's
not his fault things are bad."
"4938ae27","Actually, if not for Jijimon, we wouldn't even know how bad
things were. We should be grateful."
"4a38af9a","Argh! Whose side are you even on, Rikka?"
"4b38b10d","No one's taking any sides. I'm just calmly, objectively
telling you the truth."
"3c389990","Oh, I see! Why don't you talk about it with the other calm
people, then!"
"3d389b03","Himari!"
"4a3aee71","Don't follow me! You and I are from different worlds,
Rikka! You just don't understand me at all!"
"493aec9e","To think she could let her feelings manipulate her so...
How weak humans are!"
"483aeb2b","Hey, watch what you're saying. I know how Himari feels all
too well."
"473ae9b8","Let me tell you, it's pretty awful feeling like you're stuck
with no way out."
"4e3af4bd","Kouta..."
"4d3af2ca","No...actually, Himari's nothing like me. She's so much
stronger than I am."
"4c3af157","I'd better keep getting stronger, right, Yukimura? 'Cause if
I don't, well, I'm..."
"4b3aefe4","Taomon, you went a little too far. They're terrified, but
they're still fighting for the sake of the Digital World."
"423ae199","...This is true."
"413ae026","Perhaps I ought to have kept my temper in check. I'll give
my apologies to the two of them."
"503d367a","No, I think it might backfire if you were to go now. Let me
and {0} handle this one."
"513d37ed","{0}, can you go talk to Himari? I'll go
after Kouta."
"4e3d3314","I better go too!"
"4f3d3487","You better stay put. This is very delicate stuff. Not the
time for kids to play around."
"4c3d2fce","Hey, don't treat me like a little kid! I'm worried about 'em
too!"
"4d3d31a1","Before you go after Himari, {0}, we'd better
explain the situation to you, too."
"4a3d2ce8","We've actually found a way to determine if someone's been
infected by the BH Program."
"4b3d2e5b","!"
"483d2982","That's the good news. But there's more, I'm afraid. When we
tried testing our method on the townspeople..."
"493d2b75","Every single one of them tested positive."
"b6401543","!!!"
"b54013d0","The time the BH Program lies dormant varies from victim to
victim, and we can't yet detect when it's about to flare up."
"b84018a9","And when it does...well, you know what happens."
"b7401736","..."
"ba401b8f","So now you know how bleak things have gotten."
"b9401a1c","The virus could take hold of us just about anytime. I can
hardly believe the danger we're in."
"bc401ed5","I doubt your partners are an exception, either."
"bb401d62","We haven't got a moment to spare. We've got to form a plan,
or all of the Digital World will fall into chaos."
"be40223b","So please, {0}..."
"bd402048","Bring Kouta and Himari back, and then lend us a hand finding
a way to stop the BH Program!"
"bc425d4c","You got it!
I'll see what I can do.
I'm not sure I can do this..."
"bd425f3f","Hmm, glad to hear! That's our {0}!"
"be426092","We appreciate it. That's all we can ask. Make sure and tell
Kouta and Himari not to overdo it, either."
"bf426205","And yet you've taken it on for us anyway. We can't thank you
enough."
"b8425700","I, too, beseech you. We're entrusting you with the fate of
the Digital World."
"8ea08b00","Huh? Who's there?"
"91a08fd9","Oh, it's you, {0}. Thanks... Thanks for coming."
"90a08e66","My partner...Himari, she... I went after her, but she...
she said, ""don't come near me,"" and then she ran off..."
"93a0933f","She should be around here somewhere... I'd be very grateful
if you could help me find her."
"92a0914c","Thank you..."
"cc1cd76d","Himariiiii..."
"c91cd294","Didn't I tell you not to come near me?"
"ca1cd407","Huh? Rikka?! What's that stuff coming out of... Wait, don't
tell me..."
"c71ccf4e","Huh? Whaaat?"
"c81cd121","You sound so... Rikka, are you all right?"
"c51ccc68","Something wrooong? I'm, I'm juuust fine... Same as
aaaalwaaaays..."
"c61ccddb","Rikka!"
"c31cc902","Whooo's calling me? Himariii? Wait, who... Who's Himari?"
"c41ccaf5","It's me! I'm your partner, Himari!"
"311fb4c3","My partner...? My partner wouldn't...wouldn't be so..."
"301fb350","Wouldn't be so mean to meeeeee!!!"
"331fb829","Wait, Rikka!"
"321fb6b6","Argh! {0}, what do we do?!"
"351fbb0f","It looks like her form is altering, right? Is...is it my
fault? For pushing her away?"
"341fb99c","Please! Help Rikka! If we can't save her, she's gonna turn
into a Machinedramon!"
"f8c894fa","A-aaAAAaaaa...aaAA...m-my.. mY HEAd, ittttttttttttt'sszszzs"
"f7c89307","Rikka!!!"
"f6c89194","HI-MA-RI... he-heLP-MEEEeeEEEE"
"f5c89021","H-ungh... Gyaaaaaah!!!"
"a29270e7","Rikka!!!"
"a392725a","Himari..."
"a49273cd","I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, Rikka! It's all my fault!"
"9d9268c8","I wanted to go back home, I was worried about my sisters,
and so I got angry and took it out on you..."
"9e926abb","Himari...you have sisters?"
"9f926c2e","Yeah. They're twins. They're just in second grade. And we
don't have a mom, so I take care of them."
"a0926d81","I got so worried, thinking about how hungry they must be..."
"9992629c","But you're important too, Rikka! I can't just abandon this
world!"
"9a92640f","I wanted to fix things here and zip back to the real world
as fast as I could, but..."
"a794b77d","Things just got worse and worse, and then I went and took it
out on you, Rikka."
"a694b58a","I've been... I've been awful."
"a594b417","Himari, don't cry. I'm...all right.
{0} saved me."
"a494b2a4","Right? You...used some program on...me, didn't you?"
"a394b131","That's right! {0}, you did something just
before Rikka attacked, didn't you?"
"a294af5e","So that's why Rikka's form didn't change?"
"a194adeb","{0} explained about the prototype antivirus
program."
"a094ac78","A prototype antivirus program? I didn't know we even had
anything like that!"
"9f94aa85","But you said it can only delay the onset, right? Not prevent
it completely?"
"9e94a912","Which means Rikka could start changing again at any time..."
"d979646","Himari...do I scare you?"
"e979839","Hah, what are you talking about, dummy? I couldn't be scared
of you. You're my partner, and I care about you."
"b979360","I promise if you start changing again, I'll be the one to
stop you."
"c9794d3","So you just rest for now. Don't worry too much about it."
"11979cf2","Himari..."
"12979e65","Did you Digivolve?"
"f9799ac","Yes...I think so. My body feels...full of power."
"10979b1f","With this much strength, I can be the one to protect YOU
from now on."
"1597a33e","Someone's feeling pretty bold! But thank you. I know I can
count on you, Rikka."
"1697a491","Oh, it's Taomon's gate. Thank goodness! C'mon, Rikka,
let's get you back to town and healed up."
"1399de4f","Sounds like a plan."
"1299dcdc","Thanks so much for everything, {0}. I'm so
grateful, I want to stay near you for the rest of my life!"
"e8f865dd","One more time, Yukimura!"
"e5f86104","Yeah! Exhaust Flame!"
"e6f862f7","Come on! You think you can get to be stronger than anybody
with an effort like that?"
"e3f85e3e","They've been like this since I arrived. Training like
they're possessed."
"e4f85f91","You can tell just from looking, Yukimura isn't up to this.
But even using force, I don't think I could stop them now."
"e1f85ad8","I know I'm not setting a great adult example, but I need to
ask you to put a stop to it."
"e2f85c4b","Don't try and stop us, {0}! This is me and
Yukimura's problem to solve!"
"dff857f2","Hey, what's the matter, Yukimura? You done already?"
"e0f85965","No... Not yet..."
"cdfa7a33","That's right! Do your best, Yukimura! We'll be stronger than
anyone else out there!"
"ccfa7840","We decided we'd do whatever it takes! Even if that means
altering our form..."
"cffa7d19","?!"
"cefa7ba6","Kouta... If that's what you want, I'll..."
"d1fa807f","Not good!"
"d0fa7e8c","Brace yourself, Yukimura! As long as you don't lose your
will, all that power can be yours!"
"d3fa8345","Guh-GAAAH-guuuh...AAAAAAAaaaaahhhh..."
"d2fa81d2","Yukimura! What are you doing? Knock that curse into
submission!"
"d5fa86ab","G-GUOOHHHHHHHHH!!!"
"d4fa8538","What? Why? That's not Machinedramon..."
"5bf30af8","!"
"5cf30c6b","UOOOOOOOOOHH!!!"
"5df30dde","Yukimura!!!"
"cb8a7630","Yukimura! Please, snap out of it!"
"ce8a7a89","GOAHHHHHHHHH!"
"cd8a7916","Ugh! {0}! Please..."
"d08a7def","Please, make Yukimura calm down!"
"997f4fab","{0}. Try using my antivirus program one
more time, please."
"9a7f511e","It seems effective..."
"9b7f52f1","That is, I wonder if my auto-learning program is doing even
better than I thought it would, if it's working this well..."
"9c7f5464","?"
"9d7f55d7","Sorry, just talking to myself. Anyway, we've got other
things to worry about..."
"9e7f574a","Uh-ungh... Yukimura... I'm sorry..."
"9f7f593d","..."
"907f4140","What were you so impatient for? You're not a kid anymore...
Didn't you think for a second it might turn out like this?"
"917f4333","...Because I've got nothing. I can't do anything. I just
wanted to have something I could be sure about..."
"9e819621","{0}'s obviously special, and Himari's so sure
of herself..."
"9d81944e","I'm the only one who's just...nothing. It was the same in
the real world, too."
"9c8192db","I mean, not to brag or anything, but I did great at school
and sports, and I could read people pretty well..."
"9b819168","I'm sure I was the kind of guy people would be jealous of.
And of course I appreciated that, but all the same,"
"a2819c6d","when I had to actually think about what I wanted to do in
life, I realized I was just...empty inside."
"a1819afa","Everyone would talk about their dreams and goals, and I'd
just try and think of a single thing I really wanted to do."
"a0819907","I had this vague picture of how I'd enjoy myself, find some
job or other, get married or something, get older,"
"9f819794","and just have a pretty average, decent life, but..."
"96818949","Suddenly I felt like my footing wasn't stable anymore, and I
started to panic, thinking I had to find something."
"958187d6","And that was when I got summoned into the Digital World."
"2484a7aa","Here, I finally felt like I was special. I believed there
was something only I could do."
"2584a91d","But it turned out I was wrong."
"2284a444","I was sure of that after I met {0}. I knew
right away...that I was just an empty nobody after all."
"2384a637","And so I ended up mistreating my partner, the one I was
supposed to care for more than anyone, and now..."
"2084a17e","I'm the worst. I'm so stupid. So pathetic."
"2184a2d1","It's true. This was pretty stupid of you."
"1e849e18","You've got a partner who believes in you, and risk all kinds
of danger for you, no matter what."
"1f849f8b","A bond so strong that even in altered form, they wouldn't
lose sight of who you are."
"1c849b32","You've got friends who come running to your aid. And you
still think you're a nobody?"
"1d849ca5","Ah..."
"a86bd73","All this time, you never noticed that you had something no
one else did in your hands all along."
"986bb80","Heh... I guess so, huh? I sure am an idiot."
"c86c059","Looks like help came at just the right time. Let's get back
to town for now."
"b86bee6","We need to let Yukimura get some rest."
"e86c3bf","Yeah..."
"d86c1cc","Occupational hazard, I guess. He was trying too hard to put
up a good front."
"1086c685","Funny that as cool as he talked, he still relied on you so
much, {0}."
"f86c512","Not that I'm really one to talk. Hope you can give me a pass
there."
"1286c9eb","You ought to take a rest, too. I have a feeling things are
about to get pretty busy."
"1186c878","So the antivirus program opens up new possibilities for
altered Digimon... Fascinating."
"64a678fe","Hey, {0}. Perfect timing."
"63a6770b","Long time, no see."
"62a67598","Things have finally recovered to the point where we can
send and receive video signals again."
"69a6809d","All thanks to all of you. I can't thank you enough."
"68a67f2a","Still, I can't maintain this for long. Apologies, but let me
get straight to the point."
"67a67db7","First, about the changes to the Digital World. As you're
aware, all of it stems from the spread of the BH Program."
"66a67bc4","I tried to look into ways to solve the problem, and that was
when I managed to access the territory of this world."
"5da66df9","Changes in one world can sometimes ripple outward and affect
other worlds for the worse."
"5ca66c06","There have been times when the Digital World began to creep
into the real world, leading to disaster."
"dfa368e8","Normally that simply means we must address even issues that
seem innocuous, but this has spiraled beyond my predictions."
"e0a36a5b","The BH Program trapped me, and I almost ceased to exist
altogether."
"e1a36bce","As I was trying to shake things up, I happened to access the
Digital World's own self-purification function."
"e2a36da1","Within that process I discovered a way to digitize humans
from the real world and draw them into the Digital World."
"e3a36f14","I see. So it was like what happened to me before..."
"e4a37087","It's an emergency measure that the Digital World can take in
times of crisis, yes."
"e5a3727a","So the fact that we were summoned here was..."
"e6a373ed","Yes. It was the will of the Digital World."
"d7a35c70","Huh, it was? Guess our connection from that tournament back
in fifth grade was just coincidence, then."
"d8a35de3","The fact that I'm even able to connect and speak with you is
due to your ability to resist the effects of the crisis."
"51aad823","But it seems that our only hope against the BH Program is
for you and the Digimon to combine forces."
"50aad6b0","That's right. We've been pulling our weight, too."
"53aadb09","We've been working on Mr. Mameo's prototype antivirus
program, and it's finally getting close to completion."
"52aad996","I hadn't told you about this yet, {0}..."
"55aade6f","What with everything that happened with Himari and Kouta, I
realized my prototype might be more useful than I'd thought."
"54aadcfc","I threw together a new one and gave it to Taomon, complete
with the new test data."
"57aae1b5","Yes, that test data was quite useful. An unexpected benefit
of Kouta and Himari's...episodes, perhaps."
"56aadfc2","Uh, heh heh..."
"59aae49b","You're...welcome?"
"58aae328","It looks like this world chose its helpers well when it
summoned you."
"6ba8c25a","Only problem left is, how do we spread the antivirus
program through the entirety of the Digital World?"
"6ca8c3cd","There's a big mesh of underground network cables stretching
all over the Digital World."
"69a8bf74","If we transmit the antivirus program from Server Tower,
it ought to spread everywhere, no problem."
"6aa8c0e7","The Digital World's network isn't functioning properly right
now, though."
"67a8bc2e","I suspect that a critical cable may have suffered some
damage during that Machinedramon rampage."
"68a8bd81","Simultaneous transmission won't be possible unless we can
fix it."
"65a8b8c8","Then we'll need to pinpoint the damaged area. Let's ask
Digimon from all over for information..."
"66a8babb","Guess we've just got to tackle one problem at a time. Isn't
that right, {0}?"
"63a8b5e2","I'll gather information as well. I may not be able to
operate freely just yet, but I can at least send DigiMail."
"86ea2781","{0}! You're back!"
"83ea22c8","Whoa, Luche, don't be a barnacle! Let {0}
breathe!"
"84ea24bb","Hee hee hee. You jealous, Himari?"
"89ea2c5a","Me, jealous?! I have no idea what you're talking about!"
"8aea2dcd","Spirited as ever, I see."
"87ea2974","Hey, there you are, Mirei. How's your work coming along?"
"88ea2ae7","I've drawn up a map of the cables that make up the network
of the Digital World. And you?"
"7dea19b6","We've conducted an investigation. We surveyed the townsfolk,
new and old."
"7eea1b29","If we check our knowledge of Machinedramon appearances
against your cable map..."
"8bec6e17","We should be able to refine our search for trouble spots in
the network to a high level of precision."
"8aec6ca4","I agree. Let's get started right away."
"8dec717d","We've got it. Look here. The main cable and the
Machinedramon sightings overlap perfectly."
"8cec6f8a","And the repair kit?"
"87ec67eb","It's ready. Here you go, {0}."
"86ec6678","You received a Repair Kit from Jijimon."
"89ec6b31","The spot in need of repair is within Faulty Ex Machina.
Good luck, {0}. We're counting on you."
"69c6a614","No mistaking it, that's the spot we're looking for. Ready
with the repairs, {0}?"
"6cc6aaed","Looks like it's finished."
"6bc6a97a","..."
"66c6a15b","Confirming network restoration. We've done it! Transmission
capacity should be restored."
"65c69fe8","?!"
"68c6a4a1","Is this...a barrier? There was nothing in my sources about
safeguards like this..."
"67c6a2ce","Oh well. Now no one should be able to touch the cable. All
we need to do is just transmit the antivirus program."
"62c69b2f","Great work, {0}. Come on back to Jijimon's
house now."
"a5c1698f","We can't use the antivirus program? But it's complete, isn't
it? What's the issue?"
"a6c16b62","Technically, the program's all set. Practically speaking,
though, we've got one head-scratcher of a problem to solve."
"a7c16cd5","You know all Digimon have a different data makeup, right?"
"a0c161d0","So we tried to update the antivirus program so it'd choose
the right vaccine for each one automatically, but..."
"a1c16343","It's a pretty...unique program, so changing any bit of it
makes the effects fade right away."
"a2c16536","That's my fault. Self-taught programmer. Sorry."
"a3c166a9","Do you have any solution in mind? I doubt it'd be easy to
make a vaccine that automatically changes to fit its target."
"acc174f4","Well, I thought, maybe...what about Datamon?"
"adc17667","Datamon? Who's that?"
"aac3b005","A prodigy of a Digimon when it comes to programming. I doubt
there's anyone in this world better suited to the job."
"a9c3ae92","But there's one big problem. Datamon's a scaredy-cat. Almost
never comes out where people can see it."
"a8c3ad3f","So you dunno where Datamon is?"
"a7c3ab4c","Not a clue."
"a6c3a9d9","Datamon, huh... Wait a second."
"a5c3a866","Could that be who Yuramon from town saw on the Nigh Plains?"
"a4c3a6f3","What?!"
"a3c3a500","Well, Yuramon is basically sleep-talking most of the time,
so we can't really be sure, but..."
"b2c3bcfd","Huh. I guess Yuramon could've just been floating so softly
by, Datamon didn't even notice."
"b1c3bb0a","{0}, sorry to pile more work on you, but could
you talk to Yuramon and find Datamon?"
"b0c5f80e","I'll go too, in that case. You'll probably need help if
you're playing Digimon hide-and-seek."
"b1c5f9e1","Me too! I'm a reeeeally good hider! You'll never find me!"
"aec5f528","Great, now we'll be looking for two..."
"afc5f69b","C'mon, Luche, you're a big girl. We need you to hold down
the fort here."
"b4c5feba","Noooo! I wanna go with {0}!"
"b5c6002d","..."
"b2c5fb54","Here, {0}, I'll get her. You go on and find
Datamon for us!"
"b3c5fcc7","HEY! Lemme go, Kouta! Stay away from me, you perv!"
"ff19e0c2","Well, you sure made me work for this. Do you know how hard
it was to find anyone who knew where you were?"
"fe19df6f","What do you mean?"
"fd19ddfc","Never mind, I was just talking to myself. Anyway, hold
tight, Datamon pal, this won't hurt a bit."
"fc19dc09","Ow! What's going... My...my head!"
"fb19da96","!"
"fa19d923","Huh? That was fast. Oh well, time for Plan B."
"f919d7b0","All right, go get 'em, little Datamon!"
"819ef2d","A-AaaAAAahhHHH!!!"
"719edba","Awww, that's so sweet. You won't even fight back?"
"fa179a4c","Well, that's your fatal mistake! Finish 'em off, Datamon!"
"fb179c3f","Huh? What?! Where'd you come from?"
"fc179d92","{0}! Stop Datamon from moving! We've still got
time to use the antivirus program!"
"fd179f05","Tcheh. This wasn't part of my calculations. Time to beat it
before things get any worse!"
"58982c25","Okay, I think this should be good."
"5598276c","Thank-you. That was a-grim-situation."
"569828df","Did you know that MetalEtemon?"
"53982406","No."
"549825f9","Any idea why you were targeted?"
"51982120","None. It was very-sudden. Without a word of warn-ing,
suddenly MetalEtemon was trying to take-me-away."
"52982293","I see. Which means the goal was probably keeping you quiet
and under control...and it's not hard to guess why."
"5f98372a","I've got a bad feeling about this."
"6098389d","I cannot comprehend this sit-uation. What-is happening?"
"5d9a72bb","Datamon, could you come with us? We've got a big favor to
ask you. I'll explain on the way."
"5c9a70c8","I un-der-stand. I can no longer stay here. Please take-me
with you."
"5f9a7581","{0}, I'll take Datamon and head back to
Floatia."
"5e9a742e","When you get back, let's meet up at Jijimon's house."
"aece5038","Hey! Nice work, {0}!"
"b1ce54f1","Wait, wasn't Mr. Mr. Mameo with you?"
"b0ce531e","""Mr."" Mameo?"
"b3ce57d7","Yeah, he's my teacher."
"b2ce5664","Um...since when exactly?"
"b5ce5b3d","{0} explained about Mameo and Datamon."
"b4ce594a","Wait, so they left first? Oh no... Do you think something
could've gone wrong?"
"a7ce4533","Or it could be that they took this opportunity to escape."
"a6ce4340","What's that supposed to mean?"
"a9cc09a2","Mameo and Datamon could have been in cahoots..."
"aacc0b15","Datamon's job was to make the BH Program while Mameo called
the shots."
"a7cc065c","It would explain how an amateur like Mameo could code up an
antivirus program all by himself."
"a8cc07cf","Hmph. We cannot discount the possibility, but I can't fathom
what Mameo's objective would be."
"a5cc0376","Of course you can't, because this idea is totally baseless."
"a6cc04e9","Seriously? I'm a little late getting back and you want to
slap me in handcuffs?"
"a3cc0010","Soooo...Mameo's a bad guy?"
"a4cc0183","Look, now you went and led the innocent kid astray."
"b1cc161a","Don't worry, Luche. Mameo is all right. Probably."
"b2cc178d","Probably, huh? Well, he's guilty until punished innocent!"
"a3c9c1b9","Tee hee. That's right."
"a2c9bfc6","Um..."
"a1c9be53","Glad you could make it, Datamon. Thanks a bunch."
"a0c9bce0","It is I who-is grateful. {0} kindly res-cued me
from a dangerous sit-u-a-tion."
"a7c9c7e5","MetalEtemon, eh? That's one more problem to deal with, then."
"a6c9c672","That gadget he controlled Datamon with bothers me. The idea
of Digimon just being controlled like that..."
"a5c9c49f","Maybe MetalEtemon is the one who made the BH Program."
"a4c9c32c","Nah. MetalEtemon is an excellent fighter, but not the kind
of Digimon you'd call...""brainy."""
"abc9ce11","There would most likely have to be a co-conspirator, or
perhaps a leader."
"aac9ccbe","A co-conspirator..."
"1dc6b030","What is it, Taomon?"
"1ec6b1a3","It's nothing. We should turn to the issue at hand. Datamon,
you've grasped our present situation?"
"1fc6b316","Yes. I-have heard Ma-meo's explanation. Al-low me to assist
with the optimiza-tion of the antivirus pro-gram."
"20c6b489","Much obliged. Then do have a look at the program for us."
"21c6b67c","I-see, I-see. This may take a lit-tle while."
"22c6b7ef","Please go as fast as you can. In the meanwhile, let's
continue our preparations."
"23c6b942","Preparations?"
"24c6bb35","We'll need to confirm that Server Tower is functioning
properly so we can use it as the transmitter."
"25c6bca8","And if it isn't, we'll need to fix it...and at the same
time, to protect it."
"26c6be1b","Yup. The enemy could be at Server Tower already. We've got
to be ready to forestall them."
"27d808ef","Then I should go! Rikka's finally all healed up and ready."
"26d8077c","And we can't just make {0} handle everything
all alone!"
"29d80c35","We can do this, right, Rikka?"
"28d80a42","Of course we can."
"23d802a3","Great, then let's get going! {0}, we'll see
you later on!"
"22d80130","Himari's really throwing herself into this. She must want to
be as strong as you pretty bad, {0}."
"25d80589","Hey, I wanna help toooo!"
"24d80416","Fine, sure. I'll think of something you can do, Luche."
"2fd81547","Really?! Maybe you're not a bad guy after all, Mameo!"
"2ed813d4","{0}, just take care, won't you? The enemy has
Megas fighting for them. No letting your guard down."
"e49db6e8","Stay away, {0}!!!"
"e79dbba1","?!"
"e69db9ce","Aaahh! Not your partner too, {0}...
We have to stop them, but..."
"e99dbe87","Fine work, {0}."
"e89dbd14","Watch as the network cable you repaired becomes the fuse
that detonates the door to the old world!"
"eb9dc1ed","Mwahahaha! It's over! No...it's just begun! I, Titamon, have
lit the fire that will forge a new world!"
"ea9dc07a","What are you talking about? Wait, what did you just do?"
"dd9dabe3","I've just enhanced what you call the ""BH Program,"" and
transmitted it to the entire world at once."
"dc9daa70","Enhanced the BH Program?!"
"df9b7052","That's right. It's what's attacking your partners right now."
"e09b71c5","As it drags all Digimon down into chaos, it'll become the
cornerstone of a new world. A new order to smash the old."
"dd9b6d0c","You're the one who made the BH Program? Are you trying to
become a god or something?!"
"de9b6eff","A god? The very word is pitiful. Look at you. You cling to
these foolish ideas of government, justice, what-have-you..."
"db9b6a26","An entity such as you would never understand. I...I am the
executioner of gods!"
"dc9b6b99","Wait...stop that! If the equipment breaks, we can't transmit
the antivirus program!"
"d99b66c0","Fool! Your program is useless!
{0}, surely you must have already noticed?"
"da9b68b3","...!"
"e79b7cca","Oh...so you had the antivirus program, {0}."
"e89b7ebd","But let's make absolutely sure! Bwahaha! Drown in despair!"
"d9992869","Waaaait!"
"d89926f6","Luche?!"
"d7992503","Ngh! What are you trying to do?"
"d6992390","Watch very closely!"
"dd992e95","Wait, was that...movement? Did you actually manage to
optimize the antivirus program?!"
"dc992d22","{0}, my friend! Smack 'em down!"
"db992b4f","!"
"da9929dc","Tch! You impertinent little..."
"8e6792d5","Ngh... You're strong, I admit it. But I won't allow anything
to get in the way of my allies' plans...or mine!"
"8b678e1c","Is Titamon seriously gonna self destruct?!"
"8c678f8f","!"
"89678b36","!"
"8a678ca9","Gah! Ngh... But ah, the BH Program update...bwahaheheh...
My task is complete!"
"876787d0","Omegamon Zwart D! Is this...?"
"88678943","G-GUUUH... NNGGGUUHHHH..."
"95679dda","Is it in pain? Ah! Is this the enhanced BH Program?!"
"96679f4d","Then we might be able to get away! {0}!"
"9369d96b","Omegamon Zwart D's on a rampage! The transmission
equipment's totally done for!"
"9269d7f8","All we can do for now is run! There's no way we can beat...
that!"
"9569dcb1","Phew, well, we got away somehow... Was I always this slow?
Did I lose all my muscles studying for the entrance exams?"
"9469dade","Me too... I'm exhausted..."
"9769df97","..."
"9669de24","It's quiet now..."
"9969e2fd","Maybe that scary guy left?"
"9869e10a","Probably."
"8b69ccf3","..."
"16237f0","It's totally ruined..."
"2623963","We can't use this at all."
"3623ad6","Is that it? Is the Digital World gonna..."
"4623c49","No way. There's...got to be another way."
"5623e3c","So...we can't give up now... Gotta keep...keep on trying...
ngh..."
"6623faf","...{0}!"
"7624102","Let's go back... Go back and...figure out what to do...
together."
"4b097b63","So it even got Omegamon Zwart D? I knew the BH Program was
fearsome, but this..."
"4a0979f0","We're in a race against time! We need that information!"
"a400a88a","We'll continue with our plan for the antivirus program...
Please do hurry with your information gathering."
"1af88182","Things have sure gotten complicated, but all we can do is
keep trying our hardest!"
"41f38f4e","Huh? When did you start sounding so adult-like? Hee hee.
Sometimes that happens with Digivolution."
"f94900c2","Mirei might know why we all got sucked into this world..."
"5ee98e19","Such terrible things are happening...and what can I even do
to help?"
"9639216","Huh? Mameo disappeared! He's so fast! Where'd he go?!"
"674c4e0","So it even got Omegamon Zwart D? I knew the BH Program was
fearsome, but this..."
"774c653","We're in a race against time! We need that information!!!"
"eb9ec57d","We'll continue with our plan for the antivirus program...
Everyone, hurry with your information gathering."
"c696b30d","Actually, if Mirei might know how we can get back to the
real world..."
"c596b19a","I wonder when we'll see her again?"
"c35351a5","I think my bond with Himari has strengthened since I
Digivolved. But she'll have to go home someday..."
"86183721","Back at that tournament, I had no idea things would turn out
this way... Is it really not related to all this, somehow?"
"9c87d216","I don't want to show anyone that unseemly side of me ever
again, not even for Kouta's sake."
"e4eb07fd","Huh? Mameo was outside! But wait, now he's gone again?!
Where'd he go now?"
"c072eb31","Kouta doesn't look well at all. I think he's taking things
pretty hard... I worry about the kid."
"33760218","Kouta and the others certainly look worried, but young ones
have a knack for turning problems into fuel for growth."
"66fbad80","We've been checking transmission equipment all over, but we
still can't find information on the BH Program..."
"bc8bfd8c","Himari seems to be looking desperately for a way to contact
the real world as we check the transmission equipment..."
"bd8bff7f","...I wonder why?"
"1fefb96c","What can I do as I am right now? I get so impatient, but I
can't actually do anything..."
"20efbadf","Man, I'm so useless!"
"ad18937f","I have to get stronger so I can support Kouta!"
"9815b954","Yukimura's totally into this special training!"
"47e90e","Uh-oh. Himari's looking a bit down too, eh?"
"147eae1","I feel awful that we keep placing these burdens on you all.
But your strength is the best hope we've got."
"b7bf5013","What? Now Himari's worried too? It really is a difficult
thing sometimes, to be young."
"3e24195b","Sorry for what happened earlier!"
"3d2417e8","I guess I was just worn out? But I'm fine now! Don't you
worry about me!"
"59944d33","Why would Himari want to contact the real world that badly?"
"58944b40","I can't help but be curious..."
"53e7b04b","I've thought about it, and I know there's no way to change
it, but...I'm just not strong like you all are."
"1ee9045c","Hey! This won't do it! I need some harsher training... for
Kouta's sake!"
"d48f634b","Yukimura's really into it! He's training like crazy!"
"546c5b7","You haven't just taken on the BH Program thing, you've been
looking after Kouta and Himari, too..."
"446c3c4","But we have to worry about them first! Just bring 'em back
safe!"
"cdc79a96","Normally, I'd be the one to go and apologize to Kouta and
Himari, but..."
"cec79c09","What Jijimon said is right. I'm counting on you to take care
of the two of them."
"50e4c39a","Bring me toooo! I'm worried about Kouta and Himari!!!"
"6b1e4f14","What? Rikka's looking strange?! I have a very bad feeling
about this..."
"6c1e5087","Quick, just go after Rikka for now!"
"433184b9","I see... Rikka's in an unusual state? Could this possibly
have something to do with the BH Program?"
"66f89581","What's wrong with Rikka?! Hurry, you gotta help her!"
"dd531812","Thank goodness Himari and Rikka are back and safe! Now
it's time to get Kouta and Yukimura."
"de531985","Now where the heck can those two be?"
"22c8c02f","It seems Himari and Rikka's bonds have strengthened. What
does not kill one makes one stronger, I suppose."
"39844bf7","I never told you about my sisters, did I? I didn't want
Rikka to feel like they mattered more than her..."
"38844a04","But I think Rikka understands now! Good communication is so
important!"
"f6391597","I'm so glad to know that I'm important to Himari the way her
sisters are."
"f5391424","I want to help her get back to them as soon as she possibly
can!"
"d576c4cf","Yaaay, Himari and Rikka are friends again! Sooo now we gotta
help Kouta and Yukimura! Where'd they go?!"
"9e2f32f0","To transmit the antivirus program, we need to find the point
of damage in the main cable and repair it..."
"9f2f3463","We need all the information we can get! Keep gathering those
residents!"
"bd68a6ad","We need to find the damaged point on the main cable. So do
focus all your energies on gathering residents."
"5bcff61d","The antivirus program is almost done! Is it just me, or is
there finally a light at the end of the tunnel?"
"5acff4aa","Well, now that we've made it this far, we've got to fight
for the Digital World. It chose us to save it, after all!"
"db706015","And I'll do my best to reunite Himari with her sisters as
soon as we possibly can!"
"5060cfd1","Huh? What am I doing? I'm asking Digimon around town about
stuff!"
"4f60ce7e","Yukimura's not ready to leave town yet, so I figured there
had to be something I could do in the meantime!"
"f4c75986","Pugii? Pugii, pugii! (Did you recognize me? It's me,
Yukimura!)"
"9f97df0d","Bring lotsa Digimon, bring lotsa Digimon! This is fun!"
"ad24eeb6","The antivirus program is nearly done, but with the network
of the Digital World in this state, well..."
"ae24f029","Keep on bringing in townsfolk! We need to know where that
cable is damaged!"
"d8f26633","So the damaged point on the cable is somewhere in Faulty Ex
Machina. Quick, go patch it up!"
"eb56b33a","We're a few steps away from a completed antivirus program.
Let's keep our heads in the game. Go and fix that cable."
"cb3c1252","Faulty Ex Machina... We were just there, weren't we?"
"cc3c13c5","If we want to get inside, we've gotta lower that bridge.
Could there maybe be a switch somewhere?"
"2cbaa03e","Seems like the switch that controls Faulty Ex Machina's
bridge should be around that area..."
"2dbaa191","That's what the Digimon in town told me, anyway. Hope it
helps!"
"70661f2","All right! We know where the cable damage is! That info from
the Digimon came in handy after all!"
"8066365","I wish I could go handle the repairs with you, but hey, I
gotta take it slow and do what I can for now!"
