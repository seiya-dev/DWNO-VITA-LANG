"40e5e459","{0}! Are you okay?!"
"3de5df80","?!"
"3ee5e173","Get back, {0}! We can take it from here!"
"43e5e912","You just need to give us commands as usual!"
"44e5ea85","?!?!"
"41e5e5cc","What is it, {0}?!"
"42e5e7bf","You've always given us commands in battle!"
"47e5ef5e","?!?!?!"
"48e5f131","You seem really confused all of a sudden!"
"45e82aef","It can't be helped. We'll back you up."
"44e8297c","You've gotta be kidding me. You're not supposed to forget
us--your partners!"
"f82dae36","Ugh... So strong..."
"f72dac43","..."
"f62daad0","No good?"
"fd2db5d5","No... I have to keep going. I've finally met
{0}... And this is where I'm a goner?!"
"fc2db462","I see... We may be defeated here... But we won't let that
happen... to {0}!"
"fb2db28f","!!!"
"fa2db11c","What is this... The light of a Bond?"
"12dbc01","I can feel the power... The Bond is transforming into power!"
"2dbaae","Let's go! As long as {0}'s with us..."
"f32b67a0","We can still fight!"
"3491708c","Urgh... {0}..."
"37917545","This isn't the time to be sleeping! We must defend our
partner!"
"369173d2","Argh!"
"31916c33","{0}... You're all right..."
"30916a40","Yes, I'm okay.
What about you?"
"33916f19","Don't worry about us... We're partners..."
"32916da6","Umm... Just one thing..."
"aee268e7","Hrm?!"
"afe26a5a","The Machinedramon should have been caught in the
interdimensional trap, but..."
"b0e26bcd","Hmmm? A human? A Machinedramon disappears and a human
appears... Fascinating..."
"a9e260c8","Hmph. You defeated that Machinedramon... That must be what
destabilized the other dimension."
"aae262bb","Still, you shouldn't have been able to defeat the
Machinedramon..."
"abe2642e","Hmph. These must be your partners."
"ace26581","And two of them, no less. That's an odd relationship."
"a5e25a9c","They did everything they could to defend you..."
"a6e25c0f","..."
"b3e4af7d","Heh-heh-heh! No need to look so depressed."
"bdf4b784","This is a tremendous success!"
"c0f4bc5d","Why don't you give your reborn partners names?"
"bff4baea","Then their rebirths will be complete."
"baf4b2cb","Just remember: As their Tamer, you have a duty to care for
them."
"b9f4b158","Hmm... You don't seem to understand what's what."
"bcf4b611","I am just as in the dark as you."
"bbf4b4be","I wonder what is going on... Why don't we go to my house,
and you can tell me your story?"
"b6f4ac9f","Looks like Tokomon is still unconscious. We can treat him
there."
"5188cfa","So you were sucked in by the Digivice, and unluckily fell
into the dimension I created..."
"4188b07","And then your partners in the Digivice defeated
Machinedramon for me."
"3188994","I see. Coincidence has been our friend today. I owe you my
thanks, {0}."
"2188821","Actually... This world is at a crisis point. As you can see,
the city we are in, Floatia, is in disarray."
"118864e","It's because of the Machinedramon."
"1884db","It suddenly started attacking us for no reason, and did a
lot of damage to the city."
"ff188368","The power of an Ultimate is overwhelming... It appeared from
nowhere, caused massive damage, and then disappeared."
"fe1881f5","We were at our wits' end..."
"fd188002","I mobilized my knowledge and technology to build a trap, in
order to capture the Machinedramon."
"164664","I thought that when it appeared, I could transport it to
another dimension and imprison it."
"11647d7","The plan worked. In fact, the plan went even better than
expected."
"216494a","Thanks to you, we were able to defeat that Machinedramon."
"3164b3d","But that doesn't mean the danger has entirely passed..."
"fc164038","?"
"fd1641ab","The phenomenon of a Machinedramon getting violent and then
disappearing has occurred several times, in many areas."
"fe16431e","It would be hard to believe that it is just one lone Ultimate
Digimon doing all this damage."
"ff1644f1","We were able to survive this time because of your valiant
efforts."
"f816398c","Unfortunately, we don't know from where and how the
Machinedramon are appearing."
"f9163b7f","It seems hopeless, but if we just had a clue...maybe we
could do something..."
"721db5bf","If only we had a clue..."
"711db3cc","?"
"741db885","What?!"
"731db712","This Tokomon was the Machinedramon?! It can't be..."
"6e1daf73","No...but I am sensing a strange data wave coming from this
Tokomon, albeit weakly..."
"6d1dad80","Hmm... What should we make of this? A Tokomon living in this
city Digivolved into a Machinedramon?"
"701db259","I've never heard of such a Digivolution... Wait. There's
something here in the cloud memory..."
"6f1db0e6","But why did this Tokomon Digivolve into Machinedramon?
Or at least an altered form of Machinedramon?"
"7a1dc217","Hmmm... We won't be able to figure it out with just this
small amount of information from this Tokomon."
"791dc0a4","But it looks like we finally have a chance to actually do
something about this threat."
"6c1b6db6","We need to act!"
"6d1b6f29","I have something to ask of you, {0}."
"6a1b6a50","We want to return you back to the world you came from as
soon as possible."
"6b1b6bc3","But we can't leave this city in the state it's in."
"701b73e2","To get the city back to the way it was, will you help bring
back the residents that fled from the Machinedramon attacks?"
"711b7555","Okay. I'll help.
Why don't you do it yourself?
It's too scary!"
"6e1b709c","I'm glad you said that!"
"6f1b720f","I would do it myself, but there are too many children in the
city. I can't leave them alone."
"741b7a2e","You have to be strong. The reason you fell into this world
must have something to do with this transformation."
"751b7b81","So go out with your partners and look for the residents
who fled the city."
"6e0ea489","I will look into this small amount of strange data we have
collected from this Tokomon."
"6d0ea316","Maybe I will be able to unravel the mystery of this altered
form..."
"6c0ea1a3","If we can detect abnormal information, we may be able to
avoid further damage here."
"6b0ea030","That's why I first intend to make a detection device."
"720eab35","If I have any news, I will send you a DigiMail. So please
check your Digivice."
"710ea942","So then, {0}... I'm counting on you."
"a7fd6ff5","How is the search for the residents going?"
"a4fd6b3c","I haven't been able to detect any abnormality in the data in
the city, so please go out and look for residents."
"adab788","Oh, {0}! Great timing!"
"ddabc41","Apparently there are other humans apart from yourself in the
Digital World!"
"cdabaee","!!!"
"fdabfa7","If they've suddenly been thrown into this world in the same
way you were, they're probably in trouble."
"edabe34","Considering the strange incidents with the Machinedramon,
you should also go check them out."
"11dac28d","If we can exchange information, maybe we can find out why
humans have been pulled into the Digital World."
"10dac11a","And maybe we could solve some other mysteries, too... Like
how we can send you all home."
"3daac83","The witness reports are coming from the south of Nigh
Plains. Be careful!"
"c6d4b1e3","Himari! Look! Look! It's a human!"
"c7d4b356","Whoa, Rikka!
Don't get too close!"
"c8d4b4c9","I told you. We don't know what's going on here, so we have
to be careful."
"c9d4b6bc","But, but... This person looks kind!"
"cad4b82f","Those are the most dangerous types of people! It's not
normal, and probably not sincere!"
"cbd4b982","Hey!"
"ccd4bb75","What is it?! A human?"
"cdd4bce8","Hey, Himari. Kouta changed completely too, you know."
"ced4be5b","Hmmm... Maybe it's okay, then."
"4bd7c1f9","Even in the presence of a beautiful girl like me, he didn't
turn into a big bad wolf or anything, you know."
"4ad7c006","He looked after Pabumon and Yuramon too, after all.
Kouta really is a good person."
"49d7be93","What are you talking about?"
"48d7bd20","Nothing important. We're discussing whether or not this
person is a big bad wolf."
"4fd7c825","Anyway... At least tell us your name, okay?"
"4ed7c6b2","Before you ask someone's name, isn't it polite to give your
own name first?"
"4dd7c4df","Yukimura, you're always so formal. You said the exact same
thing when we first met."
"4cd7c36c","It's called manners. It really goes without saying."
"53d7ce51","Well, I guess I need to learn by your example.
Show us how it's done!"
"52d7ccfe","Fine. My name is Yukimura. This is my partner Kouta."
"51da09e2","I'm Kouta Hirose. Nice to meet you."
"52da0b55","I'm Rikka! I'm Himari's partner."
"4fda069c","And I am Himari Oofuchi."
"50da080f","You introduce yourself."
"4dda03b6","I see. {0}... That's a good name."
"4eda0529","Huh? {0}...
I've heard that name somewhere..."
"4bda0050","Hmmm..."
"4cda01c3","Kouta... Do you have something to eat?"
"59da165a","Only two Digishroomâ€¦ I want to go in farther,
but there's an aggressive Digimon in the way."
"5ada17cd","There's not much around here for Digimon to eat. We don't
even know how to get back to our own world."
"57dc51eb","Oh yeah! {0}, how did you get here?"
"56dc5078","{0} explained the situation."
"59dc5531","You can't get back to the real world, even from, um, Floatia?"
"58dc535e","Well... If you're still here, there really must be no
way back, right?"
"5bdc5817","Could the problem be the Machinedramon attacks? This world
is in trouble..."
"5adc56a4","No thanks to you, Kouta...
But first things first. What do we do about this?"
"5ddc5b7d","Well, let's see if we can get to Floatia. We can take these
Digimon too, right?"
"f382b716","Oh! I just remembered!"
"f282b5a3","{0}... That name you told us!"
"f182b430","What? Didn't you hear the first time?"
"f882bf35","You don't remember anything, Kouta?"
"f782bd42","I'm supposed to know this person or something?"
"f682bbef","Do you remember the national Digital Monsters tournament
when we were in 5th grade?"
"f582ba7c","Of course! We only got into the top four, but it was still
one of the best moments of my life."
"fc82c561","Me, too. We both lost in the semifinals..."
"fb82c38e","But the person who got to the finals..."
"ee807080","What?! It was {0}?!"
"ef807273","Kouta was so nervous, I don't think he'd remember you,
{0}."
"f08073e6","And Himari had just got into high school, so she probably
wouldn't know you, either."
"f1807559","Heh heh heh... Anyway... Where is Jijimon's house?"
"d6a99691","Hmm. I see."
"d3a991d8","Of the four strongest participants in the same tournament,
three have mysteriously been pulled into the Digital World."
"d4a9934b","I feel like this has to be more than just coincidence."
"d9a99b6a","This Digivice was a runners-up prize for those in the
semifinals. That must be what brought us here."
"daa99cdd","Does that mean the other semifinalist is here, too?"
"d7a99804","Maybe... Or maybe they didn't use their Digivice yet.
We can only guess..."
"d8a999f7","Digivices that only you people carry... If we weren't in so
much trouble already, I'd want to investigate these devices."
"cda98846","How dangerous are all these Machinedramon attacks?"
"cea98a39","They're very dangerous. They might mean the end of the
Digital World."
"dbabdd27","If we could do something about the Machinedramon, will you
help us get back to the real world?"
"daabdbb4","Yes. I have already made a promise to {0}."
"ddabe00d","Then you'll have our help as well."
"dcabde9a","We'll do anything we can to help, if there is a way to get
back to the real world."
"d7abd6fb","So what should we do?"
"d6abd508","{0} has been bringing residents back to
Floatia and greatly assisting in its recovery."
"d9abd9c1","There's still the threat of the violent Digimon... Would you
perhaps act as bodyguards?"
"d8abd86e","Bodyguards? That sounds super cool! Leave it to us!"
"d3abd04f","Heh! You sound motivated, at least."
"d2abcedc","Anyway, I've been building a device that will be able to
detect the presence of Machinedramon."
"49a43b4c","It will take some time for me to finish it, with just me
working on it."
"4aa43d3f","That is why I am hoping to enlist the cooperation of this
world's wisest man."
"4ba43e92","{0}, will you go to Logic Volcano and find
Taomon?"
"4ca44005","He can be something of a slow starter, so this may be a
tough request, but I'm counting on you."
"ceda264","Who are you?"
"feda73d","I'm {0}.
...
Who are YOU?"
"eeda54a","I've never heard of you. But I suppose it'd only be polite
to tell you who I am, now that you've told me your name."
"9ed9dab","My name is Taomon."
"8ed9c38","Huh... Some good-for-nothing kid who doesn't have respect
for their betters."
"beda0f1","Leave now and don't come back."
"aed9f1e","What makes you think you have the right to ask me questions,
when you trespassed in my home?"
"5ed977f","Leave and don't come back."
"4ed958c","Why did you come here, human?"
"7eb5bee","{0} relayed Jijimon's request."
"8eb5d41","Huh? Jijimon asked you to come here? That old fogey asked
you to come and get me?"
"5eb5888","I can't say that I am entirely unconcerned about the plight
of the Digital World..."
"6eb5a7b","But nature is in itself impermanent. I believe in becoming one
with the flow, like a twig on the river."
"beb621a","Furthermore, you are an alien species in this world. There
is nothing you can do to help."
"ceb638d","We can do something!
Jijimon will be upset.
You're a twig?"
"9eb5f34","I don't want to hear it. Go away."
"aeb60a7","Heh... Nothing would make that old fool cry."
"ffeb4f76","Heh... Yes, it's a metaphor to help you understand."
"eb50e9","What are you doing?!"
"1e913e5","You have to take this seriously, {0}."
"e91272","Little girl, you seem anxious about this crisis of the
Digital World, too. Why?"
"ffe9109f","You could say that."
"fee90f2c","The reason we came to see you, the so-called ""wisest
Digimon"" in the Digital World..."
"fde90db9","...is so that we can find a way back to the real world."
"fce90bc6","I was not aware..."
"fbe90a53","As an unclean being, you need only wait for the Enforcer
to cleanse you from this world."
"fae908e0","Although I don't know if that would result in you being
returned to your world or not."
"9e9205d","""Enforcer?"" If you've got an Enforcer, 
how come they haven't taken care of the Machinedramon already?"
"8e91eea","Hmm... There is logic in that question."
"7be6027c","Why hasn't the Enforcer of order in this world 
taken action against the unclean Machinedramon...?"
"7ce603ef","..."
"7de60542","What are you thinking about?"
"7ee60735","I am of a mind to grant you a single chance."
"77e5fc30","You got an Illegal Seed from Taomon."
"78e5fda3","This is a seed of unclean data which shouldn't be present
in this world."
"79e5ff16","Plant that seed in a place where it won't be disturbed by
Digimon, observe what happens in 24 hours, and report back."
"7ae60089","Now go, {0}."
"12bda747","You planted the Illegal Seed! Come back in 24 hours to see
what happens."
"4ad046be","It hasn't been 24 hours yet. Come back again later."
"2bc9916e","What is this flower? It makes me feel kind of ill."
"2ac98ffb","I've never seen a flower like this..."
"29c98e08","Taomon did say that it was a seed of unclean data that
shouldn't be in this world."
"30c9990d","It definitely isn't a flower from the Digital World."
"2fc9979a","Himari, do you think we should take the flower?"
"2ec99627","No... He told us just to report what happened to the seed.
And we don't know what'll happen if we pluck it."
"2dc994b4","Let's leave the strange flower here, and just go and tell
Taomon what we saw."
"24c98669","Okay."
"23c984f6","{0}, we'll head back to Taomon first."
"5592a3db","You're back, {0}."
"5692a54e","So tell me, what became of the Illegal Seed?"
"5792a721","{0} told Taomon that a flower bloomed."
"5892a894","I see... It grew into a flower."
"5992aa07","That's what we said. Does this mean that you'll help us now?"
"5a92abfa","Otherwise, we're going to drag you back with us if we
have to!"
"5b92ad6d","Huh... I really didn't want it to come to this. But I am
going to have to speak with that old fossil."
"4c9295f0","Old fossil? You mean Jijimon?"
"4d929763","Well... I haven't used this in a while, but here we go..."
"da95b3d1","Whoa! What's going on?!"
"d995b27e","It's a space portal."
"d895b08b","If I have been to a place before, I can enter the
coordinates and open a door that goes straight there."
"d795af18","It takes a lot of strength, though, so I can't do it too
often."
"de95ba1d","Where does it go?"
"dd95b8aa","That stuck-up bearded geezer's place."
"dc95b737","Stuck-up... He means Jijimon, right? That means it goes
to Floatia."
"db95b544","Does Taomon hate Jijimon?"
"d295a779","Well, he seems to like criticizing him..."
"d195a586","There's no point in overthinking this. Come on, Rikka."
"e097fbda","See you there, {0}!"
"5b427560","{0}! Good work!"
"5e427a39","You managed to coax the eccentric Taomon back to city for
the first time in a long while."
"5d427846","This is why people don't like hanging out with you, old man."
"60427d1f","Harrumph, I see you're as rude as always!"
"5f427bac","Um, so... You two are... friends?"
"62428065","We both like arguing... I guess that's a type of friendship."
"61427ef2","And? What is this about a Machinedramon Detector? According
to {0}, things are pretty serious."
"6442834b","I've completed the basic logic, and I've just about managed
to make a prototype."
"634281d8","But if there isn't a large abnormal data wave, it can't
detect it. Its range is limited to within this city."
"f63f978a","Thing is, this problem is bigger than just Floatia."
"f73f997d","I see... The Illegal Seed bloomed into a flower..."
"f43f94a4","Yes... The Enforcer must..."
"f53f9617","Must be malfunctioning. This is the worst-case scenario.
I never imagined things were this bad."
"f23f915e","However, that doesn't mean it's stopped operating entirely."
"f33f9331","Hey! Could you knock it off?!"
"f03f8e78","Please stop talking about things without explaining them to us!"
"f13f8feb","Oh! I'm sorry."
"ee3f8b12","The Digital World is equipped with a self-cleaning feature
to prevent data corruption."
"ef3f8c85","If it was functioning correctly, an unclean object like the
Illegal Seed would not be able to take root."
"f03d4f81","So you mean the self-cleaning function is broken?"
"ef3d4e2e","That's how it looks."
"ee3d4cbb","So if this self-cleaning feature was working, then the
Machinedramon wouldn't be attacking?"
"ed3d4ac8","Well... Who knows if the Machinedramon were caused by it
malfunctioning, or if they caused it to malfunction..."
"f43d55cd","There is no way to determine that... Hmm... I had intended
to only observe and not influence..."
"f33d545a","However, it is impossible to meditate on the flow when the
world is in such grave danger."
"f23d52e7","So you'll help?"
"f13d5174","It seems I have no choice. I will take over the creation of
the Machinedramon Detector."
"e83d4329","Wouldn't it be better to fix the self-cleaning function
before making a Machinedramon Detector?"
"e73d41b6","Then the Machinedramon issue would be automatically solved."
"ea3b0798","That'd be impossible. We wouldn't know where to begin."
"eb3b090b","I see... I thought it was a good idea..."
"ec3b0afe","Hey... Can we take a break until the machine is ready?"
"ed3b0c51","I'm afraid not. I need you to gather residents for the city."
"ee3b0dc4","Restoring the city will mean more operational facilities,
which will help us deal with the anomaly."
"ef3b0fb7","Don't forget to train your partners!"
"f03b112a","There is going to be difficult work ahead once the detector
is complete."
"f13b129d","Okay! Yukimura! Let's get training!"
"e23afb20","I like your attitude!"
"e33afc93","Let's go and find Digimon outside of the city who need our
help!"
"f44c60b7","Okay!"
"237523cd","Wait a second, {0}."
"20751f74","I want to give you this."
"217520e7","You received a Taoistic Charm from Taomon."
"1e751c2e","I use this Taoistic Charm to locate coordinates whenever I
open up a space portal gate."
"1f751d81","As long as you have this charm, I'll be able to open up a
gate to your coordinates."
"1c7518c8","Once a gate is open, it won't disappear unless I close it."
"1d751abb","It takes a lot of energy, so we can't use it too much.
Also, you can't open the gate from your end."
"1a7515e2","I think it may prove useful to you if you use it wisely."
"1b751755","You should let Kouta and Himari have one, too. Don't be
stingy."
"8773823","Don't comment on things you don't understand. I only have
one Taoistic Charm."
"77736b0","You must really like {0} if you're willing to
hand over something so precious."
"a773b09","Well... {0} has two partners, and defeated an
Ultimate Machinedramon. So I am curious..."
"9773996","Heh heh... I understand. {0}, we're
counting on you!"
"c01b4fca","Hey! You came at just the right time, {0}!"
"bf1b4e57","I was just speaking with Taomon. 
Thanks to you, this city has really started to grow."
"be1b4ce4","Taomon is here now, and we really want to make the place grow even bigger."
"bd1b4b71","If you bring even more Digimon here, we're going to need a lot more space."
"bc1b499e","Plus, we're building the detector here too, so things are
getting pretty cramped."
"bb1b482b","I want my apprentices Meramon and Kyubimon at
Logic Volcano to come and help with the upgrades."
"ba1b46b8","If we all work together, it won't take so long. Maybe even
just a single day."
"b91b44c5","It will take some time, but I think it will be worth the
wait."
"f4fbe619","Oh! You're back, {0}!
As you can see, the city's a lot bigger now!"
"f1fbe140","Because of all the residents you brought in, 
we finished early. It looks like the detector will be ready soon, too."
"f2fbe333","I'm afraid I am going to have much more work for you, but I
know that you're up to the task."
"1b3be6b2","I've been waiting for you, {0}!"
"1a3be4df","The Machinedramon Detector is ready!"
"193be36c","We did a quick survey of the whole area with it, but we
didn't pick up any signs of Machinedramon."
"183be1f9","But... There are indications of an alien data wave that might
be caused by an altered form."
"173be006","The location is in Server Desert, in a village where a lot
of Digimon live."
"163bde93","If there is an altered form there..."
"153bdd20","Whatever it is could do horrific damage..."
"243bf49d","We can't let that happen! Yukimura! We're going to Server
Desert now!"
"233bf32a","Yes, sir!"
"9638d6bc","Don't be so hasty! If we reduce the number of city
protectors, this place will also be in danger."
"9738d82f","We have to be careful not to create more problems by fixing
this one."
"9838d982","No need to worry about that."
"9938db75","Himari! And who is that...?"
"9238d070","Rikka! Digivolved from Salamon to Gatomon!"
"9338d1e3","What?! Rikka?! Why?"
"9438d356","Because Rikka wanted to protect the residents of the city
from those violent Digimon, of course."
"9538d4c9","Leave the city to us. We'll take care of it."
"9e38e314","Yep! You can leave it all to Rikka!"
"9f38e487","Wow... That's really impressive, Himari and Rikka. Yukimura
and I will do our part, too. Let's go!"
"28407817","Yes! Let's go, Kouta!"
"274076a4","How nice to be so young and full of energy..."
"2a407b7d","From the information we've collected, there still doesn't
seem to be any indication of a Machinedramon."
"2940798a","If we don't find it in time, Kouta and Yukimura may be in
danger, too. {0}, I think you should go."
"61d4be3f","Be careful!"
"62d4bf92","...Mph."
"63d4c105","You're regaining consciousness! Great!"
"5cd4b600","What?! Who are you?!"
"5dd4b7f3","Sorry... You must be scared. I'm Kouta Hirose, and this is
my partner, Yukimura."
"5ed4b966","And you are?"
"5fd4bad9","Umm... Luche... I think..."
"68d4c924","You seem confused. Must be 'cuz you're just waking up."
"69d4ca97","I was sleeping...?"
"66d704b5","You lost consciousness and fell down."
"65d702c2","What happened?"
"64d7016f","That's the question I want to ask you. Do you remember
anything?"
"63d6fffc","Umm..."
"62d6fe09","Luche... Sho... Mamemon... Umm... Mameo... Dark... Scared...
So big... So huge... Digimon...?"
"61d6fc96","I know! I came to get help!"
"60d6fb23","Help? Against a huge Digimon... You mean..."
"5fd6f9b0","Machinedramon!"
"6ed7112d","No! Dammit! We were too late?!"
"6dd70fba","Jijimon said there was a village here..."
"ecda163e","There is! Just over there! Everyone is so friendly and warm!"
"edda1791","Ah! But now it's totally destroyed..."
"eada12d8","A strange guy with a knitted hat came. He did something to
a Shoutmon, and then there was a Machinedramon!"
"ebda144b","I was so scared."
"f0da1c6a","And that's why you went to get help?"
"f1da1ddd","Yes! But then I got knocked out!"
"eeda1904","How long were you out for?"
"efda1af7","Ummm... Umm..."
"e4da0946","I can only guess, but I think it must have been less than
an hour."
"e5da0b39","Machinedramon must still be attacking! Let's go, Yukimura!"
"f2dc5e27","All right!"
"f1dc5cb4","Yukimura... Did you Digivolve?"
"f4dc610d","We don't have time to chat now, Kouta!"
"f3dc5f9a","You're right! Let's use your new power on Machinedramon!"
"eedc57fb","Yeah!"
"eddc5608","Wait! I'm coming, too!"
"f0dc5ac1","Forget about it!
I'll do something!
Leave this to the one who fights for justice!"
"369a764a","Forget about it!
I'll do something!
Leave this to the one who fights for justice!"
"efdc596e","It's okay! I'm super strong!"
"eadc514f","Wow! Thanks!"
"e9dc4fdc","The one who fights for... Kouta? You're kidding!"
"ecf55844","Luche! Stay back!"
"eff55d1d","You too, {0}! Leave this to me and Yukimura!"
"eef55baa","Yukimura, show it the power of the crimson dragon!"
"e9f5538b","You got it! Exhaust Flame!"
"e8f55218","All knocked out..."
"ebf556d1","But... you Digivolved..."
"eaf5557e","I'm sorry, Kouta..."
"e5f54d5f","Yeaarrrgh!!!"
"757210f1","Whoa... You got it!"
"72720c38","It was only a Child Digimon, but it turned into an Ultimateâ€¦
This must be the altered form."
"73720dab","I'm a little jealous..."
"7872154a","Kouta..."
"7972173d","I'm sorry, Yukimura... I didn't mean it like that..."
"76721264","No... I wasn't up to the job. I need to work harder..."
"777213d7","No! You did a good job! This is my fault... I know that."
"6c7202a6","The abnormal Machinedramon data wave has gone. The gate has
opened."
"6d720419","Let's get back to town, Yukimura..."
"7a745707","Yeah..."
"79745594","We have to take Shoutmon, too, I guess..."
"7c745a6d","..."
"7b7458fa","Luche, let's go."
"767450db","Are you sure?"
"75744f68","Of course! Right, {0}?"
"78745421","Of course you're welcome to come with us!
You should decide, Luche.
I'm not sure."
"7774524e","Thank you!"
"72744aaf","Yes! Please! I want to go with you!"
"7174493c","Oh... I see..."
"686d7f2c","Hey, {0}, don't make mean jokes!"
"696d809f","It's decided, Luche. Come on. Let's go."
"6a6d8272","Okay!"
"6b6d83e5","We'll go ahead. See you there!"
"272e4ef6","You're back, {0}."
"262e4d03","You've defeated another Machinedramon. Very impressive work,
Tamers!"
"252e4b90","But we didn't save the village... If only we had done
a better job..."
"2c2e5695","You can't take responsibility for that."
"2b2e5522","You did save Luche and Shoutmon. That was no small feat."
"2a2e534f","I guess..."
"292e51dc","I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you!"
"302e5cc1","Do you remember what happened when you turned into
Machinedramon?"
"2f2e5b6e","Umm... There was this human in a knitted hat. Then it felt
like something was changing inside of me..."
"222c0860","I don't remember anything else... Sorry, I'm pitiful!"
"232c09d3","A human with a knitted hat... So there is another person
here other than us."
"242c0b46","That's right! Luche said she saw a person wearing a knitted
hat, too!"
"252c0d39","He said something about Mameo!"
"262c0eac","Mameo?"
"272c101f","And...the man had a Mamemon thing on his hat! Like...
a patch!"
"282c11f2","I see..."
"292c1365","A man named Mameo...?"
"2a2c14d8","Of course! The person behind this is Mameo."
"2b2c164b","It's not enough information to go on, but it does seem
suspicious..."
"3432e05b","Hmm... So there is a fifth human..."
"3332dee8","That's right. The Digivices the three of you carry..."
"3632e3a1","They were prizes for being in the top four in a Digital
Monster tournament when we were kids."
"3532e1ce","Yes... The other person... The one who won the tournament..."
"3832e687","Shoma Tsuzuki..."
"3732e514","Yes! Tsuzuki! Could he be Mameo?!"
"3a32e9ed","It seems it might be a possibility..."
"3932e87a","Yes, but..."
"2c32d3e3","Shouldn't we go find him first, to be sure?"
"2b32d270","Yes... We don't know whether Tsuzuki and Mameo are the same
person, but he must have some pertinent information..."
"2e309852","It's decided! This is now a Mameo search party!"
"2f3099c5","Does Luche remember anything else about Mameo?"
"2c30950c","Umm... He had an egg."
"2d3096ff","An egg...? You mean a DigiEgg?"
"2a309226","I don't know. It just looked strange."
"2b309399","Anything else? Anything could be a clue right now. Even if
it doesn't seem to have anything to do with Mameo."
"28308ec0","My memory is really bad... I don't remember much about
myself, even."
"293090b3","Could the shock of the Machinedramon attack have made you lose
your memory temporarily?"
"3630a4ca","No... It's more than that... I can't remember anything."
"3730a6bd","I do remember being on my own. I was traveling..."
"c03839cd","Now we have one more mystery."
"bf38385a","If we can just find Mameo, everything will become clear."
"be3836e7","I think you're being overly optimistic. Finding Mameo
is going to be difficult."
"bd383574","Where there's a will, there's a way."
"bc383381","What way would that be?"
"bb38322e","There is a high probability that Mameo will be there again
if we detect an abnormal data wave, and if he's involved."
"ba3830bb","Next time we detect an abnormal data wave, you should go
there and capture Mameo before he can do anything."
"b9382ec8","That's basically what we've already been doing."
"b8382d55","Basically, yes. But your main goal will now be to capture
Mameo. The purpose has changed."
"b7382be2","This is progress of a sort."
"ba35f1c4","So we all just have to wait until an abnormal data wave is
detected?"
"bb35f3b7","Yes, for the time being."
"bc35f52a","I would be grateful if you could resume your search for
city residents."
"bd35f69d","I want to make Floatia a refuge from these Machinedramon
attacks so there are no more tragic losses."
"b635eb98","You are determined to build a secure base."
"b735ed0b","Yes. A place where everyone can be safe. That is the
principle behind Floatia."
"b835eefe","Sorry, but I'm out."
"b935f051","If we have some free time, I want to train with Yukimura."
"b235e56c","I'm out of this one, too. There are some things I need to
think through."
"b335e6df","I see... {0}, you'll help, won't you?"
"2c3d611f","Leave it to me!
I'll do whatever I can.
No."
"2b3d5fac","I knew it!"
"2e3d6465","Heheh. I see you are comprehending the concept of going with
the flow. You're almost like a twig."
"2d3d62f2","Don't be like that. It's only a small task."
"283d5ad3","All right, then. Everyone is dismissed. If we get a signal,
we'll contact you."
"34bff6c3","Here you are! Let's get started."
"35bff8b6","Are you surprised? Rikka Digivolved. But we can talk about that later."
"36bffa29","Indeed... I briefly mentioned this in my DigiMail."
"37bffb9c","We received a signal on the Machinedramon Detector."
"38bffd0f","The signal is coming from the northern part of Server
Desert. You need to head there quickly."
"39bffee2","But we also need someone to stay behind and defend the
city..."
"3ac00055","I'll stay behind. Let's go, Yukimura."
"3bc001c8","OK."
"3cc003bb","Hmm... I was going to ask for volunteers."
"39c23d59","Kouta still seems upset. I think he feels responsible for what happened."
"38c23be6","{0}, I want to go see how Kouta is doing. Will
you go over to Server Desert and check things out first?"
"37c23a73","I will open the gate to get back, so you don't have to worry
about preserving your strength."
"44d70b4f","We were waiting for you, {0}. Look at this."
"45d70d22","A Mamemon patch on his hat, and an egg... This has got to
be Mameo."
"46d70e95","What should we do, {0}?"
"3fd70390","Capture him.
Get some evidence first."
"40d70503","Good idea. We don't want to give him a chance to get away."
"41d706f6","You mean you want us to wait until we're sure he's behind
the altered forms?"
"42d70869","Seems like a big risk, but OK... I guess it'll make
things easier later."
"4bd716b4","?!"
"4cd71827","Failed again..."
"49d951c5","...but it's Machinedramon!
Although it does look a little different..."
"48d95052","Wait!"
"47d94eff","What?"
"46d94d0c","We've caught you red-handed!"
"45d94b99","Huh? What are you talking about?"
"44d94a26","If you don't move away, it'll eat you too!"
"43d948b3","Gwaaarrrrr!"
"42d946c0","Ah! Wait! Ahhhh!"
"51d95ebd","!!!"
"71f07182","Ugh! You are really annoying!"
"70f0702f","Ow! Stop yanking at me!"
"6ff06ebc","I've got Mameo."
"6ef06cc9","Mameo...? Are you talking about me?"
"6df06b56","Yes. You're the one with the Mamemon patch."
"6cf069e3","I see... Mameo? Heh. Okay. Call me Mameo."
"6bf06870","You defeated Machinedramon. Good work, {0}."
"7af07fed","You defeated Machinedramon?!"
"79f07e7a","I never thought it would be possible..."
"6cee2b0c","Are you disappointed?"
"6dee2cff","You know... I have no idea what you're talking about."
"6eee2e52","We know that you're responsible for the altered forms that
have been hurting innocent Digimon."
"6fee2fc5","Altered forms...? You mean the curse? If that's what you
think, you've got me all wrong."
"68ee24c0","I mean... I do have something to do with it, but it's not
what you think."
"69ee26b3","You need to know when to give up. You're only making it
harder for yourself."
"6aee2826","Come on! We need to know! Tell us how we can get back to the
real world."
"6bee2999","I see! So there's no way back to the real world for you."
"74ee37e4","Huh... Why?"
"75ee3957","The network between the Digital World and the real world
has disconnected."
"fef5cce7","In other words, the Digital World has become blocked off
from all other networks."
"fdf5cb74","Unless the network connections are restored, we can't get
back to the real world."
"f5cfcd","What the...? That's not good..."
"fff5ce5a","I'm in the same predicament myself. That's why I was trying
to get rid of the curse."
"faf5c6bb","The network is blocked, and my partner is in this state.
Why would I lie to you?"
"f9f5c4c8","No... I need to get home right away..."
"fcf5c981","I'm sorry I can't help."
"fbf5c82e","If there is something else you want to know, feel free to
ask me."
"f6f5c00f","There's a curse?
You came here on your own?
What is that egg?"
"f6f5c00e","There's a curse?
You came here to the Digital World on your own?"
"f6f5c00d","There's a curse?
What is that egg?"
"f6f5c00c","You came here to the Digital World on your own?
What is that egg?"
"f6f5c00b","There's a curse?"
"f6f5c00a","You came here to the Digital World on your own?"
"f6f5c009","What is that egg?"
"f5f5be9c","Yes... It's a long story... But once, a long long time ago,
there was a man who wanted to rule the Digital World."
"f8f384fe","His plans were thwarted, but before he disappeared, he left
behind a terrible curse."
"f9f38651","You have seen the effects of the curse. It forces Digimon to
turn into Machinedramon."
"f6f38198","I thought I could do something about the curse, but..."
"f7f3830b","Yes... I used the Digital Dive method to get here."
"fcf38b2a","?"
"fdf38c9d","It's a little unconventional, and even I don't know the
principle behind it."
"faf387c4","Being able to use it is like a reward for saving the Digital World in the past."
"fbf389b7","This DigiEgg is what my partner was reincarnated as."
"f0f37806","I believe my partner was attacked by a strange program, and
for protection now sleeps as a DigiEgg."
"f1f379f9","Anyway, thank you so much for defeating the Machinedramon!"
"fae6bc31","The curse exists because I didn't defeat that man
when I had the chance..."
"f9e6ba5e","I wanted to fix it and that's why I used the Digital Dive to
try and help the Digimon affected by the curse."
"f8e6b8eb","But I'm kind of out of my element here, and at somewhat
of a loss."
"f7e6b778","I hope that you will be able to help me some more in the
future."
"fee6c27d","Thank you... I need to ask you something. I've never seen
someone with two partners..."
"fde6c08a","But setting that aside for a moment... Can you tell me what
you know about the situation?"
"fce6bf17","{0} explained what's happened so far."
"fbe6bda4","I see... The self-cleaning function is malfunctioning."
"f2e6af59","I think we've resolved a few things here, but the question
as to why the abnormalities are happening remains."
"f1e6ade6","..."
"f4e473c8","What?!"
"f5e475bb","Kouta! Has something happened in the city?!"
"f6e4772e","No! But it's serious!"
"f7e47881","Ah! Mameo!"
"f8e47a74","This is Mameo?! Wow... Tsuzuki, you've aged!"
"f9e47be7","No! This is a different person! Anyway, what's happened?"
"fae47d5a","The detector has been getting a new signal! It's not just
one or two..."
"fbe47ecd","The reading is massive!"
"ece46750","We need to get out of here quick! We can't let ourselves
be surrounded!"
"ede468c3","Mameo...?! Did you...?!"
"66ebe303","All I can tell you is it sounds like a false accusation. But
is now really the time? We're in a hurry."
"65ebe190","No... We're already too late..."
"68ebe669","What should we do?!"
"67ebe4f6","{0} has taken on one... Rikka has experience
too, but these numbers..."
"6aebe94f","We'll figure something out! Yukimura, lead the way!"
"69ebe7dc","Whoa! That thing is huge!"
"69ebe7dd","Ah!"
"6cebec95","This will take all of our strength!"
"6bebeb22","Whooaaaahhh!"
"6eebeffb","Is this it...?"
"6debee08","No! It isn't! I am definitely getting back home to the real
world!"
"e9043a","It's looking bad, but we can't give up!"
"1e905ad","!!!"
"fee900d4","What is that?!"
"ffe90247","Argh... It's coming!"
"fce8fd8e","What...? Just looking at it... Can't stop trembling..."
"fde8ff61","That Machinedramon... with a single blow?"
"fae8faa8","What kind of power IS that?!"
"fbe8fc1b","Fighting for ""justice""?"
"f8e8f742","Hopeless... This one's..."
"f9e8f935","Grrraaaawwwrrr!"
"82dd048d","We've got to get out of here, Himari!"
"81dd031a","Okay!"
"80dd01a7","Kouta! We need to do the same."
"7fdd0034","Sure thing!"
"7edcfe41","It's too fast! We can't escape!"
"7ddcfcee","Grrraaaawwwrrr!"
"7cdcfb7b","No... Is this really it?"
"7bdcf988","Sakura... Nazuna... I'm sorry..."
"7adcf815","Taomon's gate?!"
"79dcf6a2","Jump through it."
"7cdabc84","A woman's voice... That's not Taomon?"
"7ddabe77","Just jump through! There isn't time!"
"7edabfea","We'll be eaten either way!"
"7fdac15d","Go!"
"78dab658","Here goes nothing!"
"e3a12896","Bring all the scattered Digimon here, so that we can combine
our strength and somehow ride out this crisis."
"e4a12a09","We must not panic. First, we need to train our partner
Digimon in the Training Hall."
"e1a125b0","Leaving the city while they're still in training is too
dangerous... Be patient and wait until they're rookies."
"bcf7446b","There are witness reports of a human in the south of
Nigh Plains."
"bbf742f8","We might be able to collect some good data. I'm going to
leave this to you."
"b1627b15","I need you to bring Taomon back from Logic Volcano.
It's going to be difficult, but I'm counting on you."
"2299c80a","What?! ...Plant an Illegal Seed?!"
"2399c9fd","I see... That might actually work."
"2099c524","...?"
"2199c697","No... It's nothing... Just do what Taomon says..."
"ee0218ad","I see... You planted an Illegal Seed... The only thing to do
now is wait..."
"337f597f","The Illegal Seed bloomed into a flower...? This doesn't
bode well..."
"327f578c","First report to Taomon and bring him back here. I'll explain
more after that."
"1ae96299","Taomon is an old acquaintance. When this city was first
built, he helped me a lot."
"3d052eae","Digimon are indispensable to the restoration of the city.
First aim for a Prosperity of 20!"
"4e813863","We have detected an abnormal data wave in Server Desert!
It's not Machinedramon, but you still need to be careful!"
"4d8136f0","Make sure you keep your partner at peak performance!"
"1d996f85","A Machinedramon appeared! Are you okay? I'm also worried
about this girl, Luche."
"1c996e12","Whatever happens, we need to defeat the Machinedramon first,
before it does more harm!"
"a5b05f5b","Until Taomon picks up an abnormal data wave, keep looking
for city residents."
"66373e86","Quickly go to the north of Server Desert! There is a high
probability that you will encounter Machinedramon."
"67374079","Time is of the essence, but you need to make sure you're
fully prepared."
"5078ba8f","You should make sure that you plant the Illegal Seed in a
place where it won't be disturbed by other Digimon."
"4f78b91c","Report back to me about what happens to the seed after
24 hours."
"85106a6c","Did you plant the Illegal Seed? Then wait 24 hours and
report back to me after you find out what happens to it."
"b5426d78","That old man has always needed my help. It seems no matter
what I do, I can't shake him."
"eb8ec1bb","Leave the creation of the Machinedramon Detector to me.
You should look for more residents."
"966011da","We need to do something... I'm concerned about the Digimon
in the village falling victim to a Machinedramon."
"3237695c","I'm worried about the Digimon in the village where we picked
up the Machinedramon signal..."
"33376acf","There is no time to waste! Get rid of that Machinedramon!"
"7bdb0e32","I haven't confirmed a new abnormal data wave... All we can
do is wait. Use this time well."
"e49470d3","The signal is coming from north of the Server Desert. Mameo
might be there..."
"e3946f60","You should set out as soon as possible..."
"2493a314","Let's find Taomon and get back to the real world as quickly
as possible!"
"69d00777","I think this would be a good place to plant the Illegal Seed
that Taomon gave us."
"65d4b2d4","Now that we've planted the seed, all we have to do is wait 24 hours.
That guy really is bossy though..."
"66d4b447","Huh?! We'll definitely be able to help!"
"c1b43483","We have to find as many residents as possible! Let's head
out right away!"
"897c242a","Rikka has Digivolved, so you can rest easy leaving the
protection of the city to us."
"8afcbec4","There's a Machinedramon?! I'm worried about Kouta, all by
himself... Please go and help right away!"
"811a5802","It looks like it's going to take some time to get back
home... I've tried everything, but I can't make contact..."
"821a59f5","We have to put our trust in Mameo!"
"94ca6bb4","Leave the protection detail to Rikka! You focus on finding
Taomon!"
