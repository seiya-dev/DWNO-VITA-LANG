not very good at it..."
"1d2ae22b","Won't someone teach me how to fly?"
"222ae9ca","Keep trying, you'll get it!
I don't think it's possible."

"8fa00162","Hmm, it's no good... I can't think of anything..."
"8e9fff8f","I may be weak, but I want to help people. The problem is, my
only skill is making this thread..."
"8d9ffe1c","I'm confident in its strength, but what can I use it for?"
"8c9ffca9","How about knitting?
Make it into a lifeline?
Use it for fishing line."
"8b9ffb36","Knitting, huh...but how could that help people? Hmm...
I get the feeling there's a better solution..."
"8a9ff943","I'll think about it a bit more..."
"899ff7d0","It'd be perfect for helping people, but...I don't want to
think about what'd happen if it broke!"
"98a00f4d","If someone got hurt because of my thread... Just the thought
of it gives me chills!"
"97a00dda","Sorry, I just can't handle the responsibility!"
"8a9dbaec","Calm down!
Nobody's gotten hurt yet!"
"8b9dbc5f","Oh! Yeah, you're right... Okay, deep breaths..."
"8c9dbe32","Right, I'm okay now... Sorry, before I knew it I had a panic
attack..."
"8d9dbfa5","Yeah.. the lifeline thing's too scary for me. Let's think of
something else..."
"869db4a0","Something that is KIND of helpful... I wonder..."
"879db613","Fishing line! What a great idea! Even I could make something
like that."
"889db786","Wait... I don't have anything I could use as a fishing rod.
Hey, could you help me find a stick or something?"
"899db979","Sure!
I guess...
No dice."

the end..."

you! Here's a little something to say thanks."

Lord Taomon?"
"b0d1ee0e","Oh, I didn't expect to see a human here... What a rare
sight..."
"b1d1efe1","No, perhaps this is fate... I have a request to ask of you,
noble human."
"aed1eb28","You know Lord Taomon?! What a stroke of good fortune."
"afd1ec9b","I have a request for you, dear human... Will you heed it?"
"acd1e7c2","My name is Renamon. I was Lord Taomon's chef."
"add1e9b5","I was to cook a meal that would make Lord Taomon's tongue
sing! I thought up the recipe and sought out ingredients..."
"1ad4d383","...but then Lord Taomon went off somewhere. Still, I refuse
to give up."
"19d4d210","This, the ultimate dish I put my all into...I want my lord
to taste it."
"1cd4d6e9","That's when it hit me. If I threw a banquet here, my lord
would surely appear!"
"1bd4d576","So I resumed my search for ingredients, but one still eludes
me, I'm afraid..."
"1ed4d9cf","The ingredient I still need is called a Digicarp."
"1dd4d85c","You're the only one I can ask... Please do something to help
this poor servant."

Um, now's a bad time..."

your care."
"21d4de88","It needs to be fresh, so please, do hurry back with it."
"a8cd6448","Oh, are you busy at the moment? Well then, whenever you are
able..."
"a9cd663b","Do save this humble servant, somehow..."
"86611ece","Oh... Lord Taomon..."
"85611d5b","What did I need to catch?
Please wait a bit longer."
"84611be8","A Digicarp... That is what I need to complete my dish."
"8b6126ed","Yes, I shall wait. Please bring a Digicarp for my recipe."
"2eedc6bb","Oh... Lord Taomon..."
"2fedc82e","What did I need to catch?
Please wait a bit.

the bottom of my heart."

my banquet tonight!"

so it's incomplete. It lacks something."
"d552c28e","...I want Veemon to get stronger, so I said ""that move lacks
something,"" you know."
"d852c747","Then that 'mon just got mad and ran off! ...I must have been
too harsh."

worried..."

lifesaver! *cough*"

"322c2186","Oh, that's it! You got me a Magma Lozenge!"
"312c2013","You handed over the Magma Lozenge!"

energy!"

Flames I want!"

thank you..."
"342c24ec","I have a special talent, you know. I'll unleash it in the
city!"

"73fbcd0","Never thought I'd meet one of you in this desert! What
brings you here, anyway?"
"83fbe43","Gimme some Cyber Grease!
Nothing, actually."
"d3fc662","Truth be told, I've got some Cyber Grease on me. But what
are you gonna use it for?"
"e3fc7d5","I mean, a human like you wouldn't need it, right?"
"b3fc31c","This stuff's for Digimon, see. You can't use it to fry up
some greasy eats, know what I'm sayin'?"
"c3fc48f","Me, I use it for repairs on my Gatling arm. I need the stuff
so I can't just be giving it away."
"113fccae","(You talked about GrapLeomon.)"
"123fce01","Uh oh, GrapLeomon's in a bind?! We're brothers in arms--
spinning arms, to be exact!"
"f42083f","In a desert like this, getting sand into that turbine is the
worst!"
"e42064c","If I'm not careful, sand gets into my Gatling arm real quick
and messes it up."

this wide, open space!"
"10420992","I can shoot off my Gatling gun 24/7! This is the life!"

take this."
"a420000","You got the Cyber Grease!"
"d4204d9","For someone with stationary arms, you're not bad! Let's be
friends, too!"

are you gonna use it for?"

"4a08f6f8","Is that right? Then no problem!"
"e71792c","Hey you! Come help me out over here!"
"11717de5","?"
"10717c72","The truth is, my brother Leomon is fighting a tough battle
in the Ohguino Wilderness beyond this sand wall..."
"b717453","I want to destroy this wall and go help at once, but the
turbines on my arms got sand in them and broke down..."
"a7172e0","I can't use my special moves like this! That's why I need
your help..."
"d7177b9","Gargomon has the Cyber Grease I need to fix my turbines.
Could you get it for me?!"
"c7175c6","You got it!
I can't right now."
"17718777","Great, that'd really help me out!"
"16718584","Gargomon should be around here in the Server Desert
somewhere! Thanks again!"
"896e6916","I see... Well, if you come back through here, I'll ask you
again! Please, do come back!"

from Gargomon!"
"4746027a","Gargomon should be here in the Server Desert! I beg of you!"
"1c7cee1a","I have awaited your return! I see you've brought the Cyber
Grease I need!"
"1b7ceca7","You handed over the Cyber Grease!"
"1a7ceb34","Okay... Time for me to fix my turbines! First brush sand out
of the rotator, then apply Cyber Grease to the bearings..."
"197ce941","Now turn in slowly, letting it seep in... Great! Repairs
complete!"
"187ce7ee","As for this sand wall... I'll destroy it with all my power!
Special move...the King of Fists!!!"
"177ce67b","Whew... Now I can finally go help Leomon. ...Ugh, what
the--?!"
"167ce488","Oh no! It looks like my repairs weren't finished..."
"157ce315","My turbines are all scorched from using my special move...
I don't think I can go on like this..."
"147ce1a2","...Oh, I know! Could you go instead?"
"177aa784","Please, go to the Ohguino Wilderness and help Leomon for me!"
"187aa977","I'll go for you!
That's a bit much..."
"197aaaea","You have my thanks! I apologize for all these requests, but
your strength is needed!"
"1a7aac5d","But I have no one else to ask! I need you to do it!"
"137aa158","Lastly, let me teach you the motto Leomon and I share..."
"147aa2cb","If you say it, Leomon will know you're there in my place,
and will trust you for sure! Our motto is..."
"157aa4be","""No Meat, No Digi-Life!"""
"167aa611","Words left behind by a wise carnivore, they say..."
"f7a9b2c","...?"
"107a9c9f","Anyway, I'm counting on you to help Leomon! I'll return the
favor in your city!"

without permission?!"

that...it means you're ready to face the music, right?!"
"8cf63be7","I'm sorry!!!
Whatever falls here belongs to everybody!"
"8df63d5a","As long as you understand, I'll let you off the hook this
time!"
"8ef63ecd","But don't think there'll be a second time... Remember, this
turf belongs to me..."
"7ff62750","Grr... You're just a punk that doesn't listen to reason.
Guess that means you're after my turf!"
"80f628c3","Know your place, punk...or I'll be the one to teach it to
you!"
"a61f07c0","Hey punk... I told you this is my turf, didn't I? What the
heck do you want?!"
"a91f0c99","Nothing, nothing at all!
You can't have it all to yourself!"
"a81f0b26","Hmph... In that case, get lost. This is my turf, and mine
alone..."
"ab1f0fff","You're just a punk that doesn't listen to reason.
Guess that means you're just after my turf!"
"aa1f0e0c","Know your place, punk...or I'll be the one to teach it to
you!"
"fda652d","What in the... I...I lost...?"
"cda6054","I...I guess you might be right. Maybe this place doesn't
belong to anybody..."
"dda61c7","All right, I'll open up my turf...but don't think I trust
you completely, punk."
"ada5d0e","I'm gonna stick around for a bit..."
"bda5ee1","I'll see with my own eyes whether or not you're fit to use
this place!"
"7afacd12","Think of all the things you gather here as treasure, and use
them wisely!"
"79facbbf","That's what someone fit to use this place would do..."
"8055fb9f","Today we gotta talk, punk. I've been watching you this whole
time, see?"
"8155fd72","Watching to see how you'd use the things you get here...
whether you're fit to use this place..."
"8255fee5","Truth is, you've been going about it the right way. The way
the city's developing is proof of that."
"7b55f3e0","I've got to hand to it you, you're the right person to use
this place...and from now on, you'll be its guardian!"
"7c55f553","That's all I had to say. Now then... What'll I do from now
on, I wonder?"
"7d55f6c6","...Oh yeah, that'd work! I'll move to the city!"
"7e55f8b9","Whaddaya know, I get some good ideas every once in a while!
Looking forward to seeing you again in the city!"

"475b3cfd","I...I guess you might be right. Maybe this place doesn't
belong to anybody..."

from now on, I wonder?"

Colosseum lately..."

champion of the city Colosseum..."

engage you in combat..."
"3ea86f9d","If you can beat me in 30 seconds, I promise to become your
ally. What do you say?"
"3da86e2a","Cool! Let's fight!
Not right now, thanks..."
"3ca86cb7","Well met, Tamer! Now then, show me that power famed in the
Colosseum!"
"3ba86ac4","...You disappoint me, Tamer. Should you change your mind,
feel free to call on me anytime!"
"bdfa54dd","Have you come to accept my challenge? Allow me to remind
you..."
"bafa5004","Should you defeat me in 30 seconds, I promise to join your
ranks. Now then, shall we battle?"
"a08c6530","...That's all you've got?"
"a38c6989","The Colosseum has certainly gotten soft in my absence!
Back in my day, I daresay you'd never see such weaklings..."
"a28c6816","Still, I believe you have room to grow... Feel free to try
again anytime!"
"7ac3588f","...Hrrm! Splendid!"
"7bc35a62","Such power! Your reputation in the Colosseum was well-
deserved! As promised, we are comrades. To the city I go!"
"7cc35bd5","I'll join the Colosseum again, but not as a fighter... Until
next we meet!"

"e0ae763e","HUMAN...ARE YOU MASTER TO MACHINEDRAMON?"
"dfae744b","TELL ME, FOR WHAT PURPOSE DID YOU DESTROY THE DOMICILE
I WORKED SO HARD TO CREATE?"

"e5ae7ddd","I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW HUMANS THINK, BUT I WILL MAKE YOU
SUFFER!"

(Best to just run away from this one...)"
"e3ae7af7","I...CAN'T TELL YOU HUMANS APART. ...ANYWAY! YOU WILL FIGHT
ME, AND YOU WILL PAY!"
"e2ae7904","RUNNING AWAY, ARE YOU? DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT
PUNISHMENT!"
"6500631d","A HUMAN... I CAN'T TELL YOU HUMANS APART..."
"62005e44","STILL, YOU WILL PAY FOR DESTROYING MY DOMICILE!"

SAMPLE YOUR STRENGTH, THAT'S ALL."

OF THAT LYING HUMAN..."

"a35e136e","Ikkakumon wants to eat your food!
Nothing, nothing at all!"
"a45e14c1","Ikkakumon said that? ...I see. ...It's true that I used to
work as a chef, but..."
"a55e16b4","But I quit when faced with my great mission as an angel...
Still, making food is also an important job..."
"a65e1827","Hunger has been a prevalent source of conflict since ancient
times...its satisfaction, the foundation of peace..."
"a75e199a","...Very well! I'll bring my cooking skills to your city!"
"a85e1b0d","This is the advent of my new holy mission! Do pass this news
on to Ikkakumon."

"a7605871","If you ever have something to talk about, do come back..."
"ca22934d","Oh, a human! A most fortuitous meeting, indeed."
"c7228ef4","I am Magnamon, of the Royal Knights!"
"c8229067","I was looking for you! Please give me your autograph!
Um, bye!"
"c5228bae","What?! My...autograph? I don't understand..."
"c6228d01","Were you summoned to save this world from peril? Or perhaps
you came to take it over?"
"c3228848","The Royal Knights are always summoned for such magnanimous
events..."
"c4228a3b","Ah, I get it. You were contracted to do something terrible
to me, weren't you! Harrumph! Unforgivable! "
"c1228562","Bye...? I see, so you're not that human I've been hearing
about lately."
"d27700ee","Wow, how strong you are! My apologies, it appears I was in
error."
"d176ff7b","(You talked about ExVeemon.)"
"d076fd88","Hmm, ExVeemon, you say... Well...if you really need it,
I suppose I'll give you my autograph..."
"d777088d","?!"
"d677071a","...on one condition!"
"d57705a7","Tell this ExVeemon not to fawn over us Royal Knights.
If anything, aim to overthrow us!"
"d4770434","Er, I guess ""overthrow"" is a bit much. Still, one doesn't
get stronger through adoration alone...right?"
"cb76f5e9","You got Magnamon's Autograph!"
"ca76f476","I think I'll head to the city for my original goal. I assume
that's all right with you?"
"cd74ba58","I understood everything about you through our battle.
Royal Knight Magnamon will lend you strength!"
"ce74bbcb","Magnamon joined the city!"
"fc40135b","Oh, a human! A most fortuitous meeting, indeed."
"fd4014ce","I am Magnamon, of the Royal Knights!"
"fe4016a1","I was looking for you! Please give me your autograph!
Um, bye!"
"ff401814","What?! My...autograph? I don't understand..."
"401987","But still, before you ask for something, shouldn't you have
some space to hold it first?"
"1401b7a","""Don't underestimate the importance of an open inventory.""
That's what they teach us in the Royal Knights! ...Probably."
"2401ced","Bye...? I see, so you're not that human I've been hearing
about lately."
"68329e82","I finally found you, {0}! It is I, Leopardmon
of the Royal Knights!"
"67329d2f","Are you to become panacea or poison for this world?
This, I came to ascertain for myself!"
"66329bbc","You seem like an excellent Tamer...but that is why!
Exactly why! You could become a threat to all Digimon."
"653299c9","If you insist on living among us Digimon, then fight me.
Through battle, prove that you have what it takes!"
"64329856","Let's do it!
I don't think I can right now..."
"633296e3","Now I shall ascertain your true power!"
"62329570","If you fight with confusion in your heart, I cannot see your
true power... I'll wait for your challenge, Tamer!"
"f002e541","Oh {0}, has your uncertainty passed?
If so, I'll say it once more..."
"ed02e088","If you insist on living among us Digimon, then fight me.
Fight me, and prove you have what it takes!"
"d2df63d4","How wonderful, {0}! I acknowledge you..."
"d5df68ad","Surely you have what it takes to live alongside Digimon..."
"d4df673a","...and for me to offer my assistance! When next we meet,
this power is at your command."
"cfdf5f1b","Leopardmon joined the city!"
"40abdb5f","Wait, am I getting ahead of myself? You got something you
wanna say to me first?"
"41abdd32","Zudomon says sorry!
Nah, I got nothing to say to you..."
"42abdea5","Eh, my master said that?! ...Even though it was my bad...
Y'see, the other day he made me a fat stack of pancakes..."
"3babd3a0","I suggested using my tail instead of a griddle... ""Don't use
your work tools to cook, dummy!"" he says."
"3cabd513","I got pissed at the time, but my master was right, y'know?
A Digimon's only weapon in battle is its body."
"3dabd686","I wonder if he still thinks of me as his pupil? All right,
I'll go to the city and wait for him to show up!"
"3eabd879","Gumdramon joined the city!"
"47abe644","What'd you wanna talk about?! You just killin' time or what?"
"48abe837","Me?! Nah man, I ain't no slacker like you!"
"56ec2d94","Say, you got a bit of a reputation, yeah? Word on the street
is you're pretty strong!"
"59ec326d","Having trouble finding someone to help hone that strength?
I can help you out, if ya want!"
"58ec30fa","My special rubber armor gets harder with each fight, and
soon it'll look real nice!"
"53ec28db","That's why I wanna fight some more. All you can get
stronger, too, it's a win-win!"
"52ec2768","Cool! Let's throw down!
I'm not gonna fight now."
"55ec2c21","Yo, that's what I'm talking about! Let's get to it!"
"54ec2a4e","A'ight, I did just ask outta the blue kinda... Whenever
you're ready, you know where to find me!"
"92e6f10f","Good to go? I'm ready to take you on anytime!"
"93e6f2e2","All right, here I come!"
"ec3f6842","Oh wow, I can see it now! You're a tough bunch, that's for
sure."
"eb3f66ef","If I didn't have this special rubber armor I wouldn't be
able to move. Even my armor seems happy right now!"
"ea3f657c","Hey, wanna do this again sometime? I'll go to the city, so
let's make it a weekly thing! Later!"
"e93f6389","Arresterdramon joined the city!"
"713e391","Hey, you! Lately everyone and their granny-mon is talking
about some human, that you?!"
"413ded8","Hmm...say, are you the type that's into music? You give off
that vibe, y'know..."
"513e04b","I mean, everyone's got their tastes, but I get the feeling
you and I are on the same wavelength!"
"a13e86a","What's your key, F minor? ... No wait, E major...
...Maybe B flat minor?!"
"b13e9dd","Actually I used to be in a band! You can tell?
Sorry...I don't know the first thing about music."
"813e504","That's right! Boy, I knew it! How about we duel in a
harmonious duet?!"
"913e6f7","And here I thought you'd pick up what I was putting down..."
"a0369552","Oh hey, it's you again! I knew it, you've got a thing for
music, don't ya?"
"9f3693ff","We're on the same wavelength, I can tell... Ohhh, I see...
It was A major all along, right?!"
"a591c3df","Hahaha, what an awesome jam session! Our harmony shook me to
the Digi-bone!"
"a691c5b2","...Okay, I've decided! I'm gonna go to the city and set up
a place just for you!"
"a791c725","The Digital World will be groovin' to our tunes, man!"
"a091bc20","OmegaShoutmon joined the city!"
"b6b3dcf3","What do you want? This one does not know you."
"b7b3de66","Someone told you to come here? Hmph, no one comes to mind."
"b8b3dfd9","Give back the Myobrella you stole!
...Or maybe not."
"b9b3e14c","""Myobrella""? This one has not heard of such a thing."
"bab3e33f","Nor has this one met a Myotismon..."
"bbb3e492","...Oh! Uhhhh... Wait, forget this one said anything."
"bcb3e605","It was a slip of the tongue, this one knows not of such a Digimon!
If you would doubt this one, fight and find out for yourself!"
"bdb3e7f8","If you have no business for this one, be on your way."
"d98a95d8","Aaaaugh! This one was defeated so readily...!"
"dc8a9a91","Hmph... Very well, this one admits it. You have indeed found
your thief."
"db8a993e","You see, this one is actually a treasure hunter. Sometimes
such hunting includes pilfering a wealthy 'mon's treasure."
"de8a9df7","This one did not realize how much value the object in
question held to its original owner."
"dd8a9c04","Look, is it not simply a jet-black umbrella? As such, it
would fetch a paltry sum at the market."
"e08aa0dd","Well, one 'mon's trash is another 'mon's treasure..."
"df8a9f6a","Oh, it is to protect against the harmful rays of the sun?
But Myotismon looked fine to this one... perhaps it's for fashion?"
"d18a8960","At any rate, this one will return what was stolen."
"548785c2","You retrieved the Myobrella!"
"558787b5","Apologies, this one seeks no profit, but a treasure hunter's
skills dull without use..."
"528782fc","Hmm, perhaps this one can do something in Floatia...
Let us see what opportunities await."
"50877f96","Turuiemon joined the city!"
"55ba5545","What do you want? This one does not know you."
"52ba508c","Someone told you to come here? Hmph, no one comes to mind."
"53ba527f","Give back the Myobrella you stole!
I think I got the wrong person."
"50ba4da6","""Myobrella""? This one has not heard of such a thing."
"51ba4f19","But before that, one should not start such talk with a full
inventory, Tamer."
"4eba4a40","This one knows nothing of items stolen by nefarious Digimon.
That matter is left to you."
"4fba4c33","If you have no business for this one, be on your way."
"4ac628fd","...Hmm? Hey, what's your deal?!"
"47c62424","(You talked about Angemon.)"
"48c62597","What, Angemon? That Digimon is still trying to capture me?!"
"45c620de","Don't think I'll be fooled by talk of you checking out my
wounds!"
"46c622b1","(Gotta fight, huh...)
(I'll retreat for now...)"
"43c61df8","If you won't skedaddle, I'll show you what I'm made of!"
"44c61f6b","Ow-ow-ow... You won't fool me!"
"531a961e","*tsk* You again?! You're a stubborn one, ain't ya?"
"521a94ab","If you're gonna be Angemon's lapdog, then come at me!"
"e51145cb","Ouchie-wah-wah... Aw man... Angemon's gonna dissect me
for sure..."
"e61147be","...Huh? I wont be dissected? But isn't that what medicine's
all about?"
"e7114911","It's not?! Boy, I must've checked out the wrong wiki...
Tell Angemon I said sorry, 'kay? Peace out!"
"e8114a84","Hackmon joined the city!"
"7b27bc00","I am Birdramon... I was commanded to guard this gate by Lord
Taomon."
"7e27c0d9","You... You are not from this world, are you? Begone at once,
interloper!"
"31bfd8fb","I am Birdramon... I was commanded to guard this gate by Lord
Taomon."
"32bfda6e","You... You are not from this world, are you? Begone at once,
interloper!"
"33bfdbc1","I'll turn back for now...
Jijimon asked me to, you know!"
"34bfddb4","Then go... I have no desire to chase down any who withdraw."
"35bfdf27","What? Is this true? ...No, for all I know you're just
dropping Jijimon's name!"
"36bfe09a","If you truly want to pass, then fell me in combat! Only then
I will trust in your words!"
"37bfe20d","I'll turn back for now...
Just remember, you asked for it!"
"28bfca90","Very well, let us begin!"
"29bfcc03","Hmph, scared, are you? The sooner you disappear, the better!"
"8933310e","Ugh... It seems your words ring true, stranger..."
"88332f9b","As the defeated, I have lost the right to guard this gate...
As promised, you may pass."
"87332e28","I am not the only guardian...but perhaps if it's you...
For now, I will return to Floatia with haste."
"8e33392d","Birdramon joined the city!"
"921149ab","...Who the heck are you?"
"93114b1e","I am Meramon! I endeavor to guard this gate at the behest
of our leader, Lord Taomon."
"94114cf1","Beyond this gate is Lord Taomon's territory... I cannot
simply allow some nobody to pass through."
"95114e64","If you wish to pass, then you must defeat me first!"
"96114fd7","You're going down!
I'm not ready yet..."
"9711514a","Ho ho! You think you can beat me?! I'll burn that confidence
right to the ground!"
"9811533d","I see...going at it half-cocked will barely light a fire
under us... I look forward to fighting you. I'll wait here!"
"c41c7030","You're back! Does that mean you're in tip-top shape?!"
"e18a5fdd","I see... That passion, that strength that doesn't lose out
to my flame... You are qualified to meet Lord Taomon..."
"de8a5b04","Very well... I'll let you pass!"
"df8a5cf7","Still, beyond this point awaits an even stronger gatekeeper!
You'd better not let your guard down!"
"dc8a583e","Meramon joined the city!"
"b02aeae","...You are the human that wants to meet Lord Taomon, yes?
You are something else, to have defeated Meramon."
"a02ad3b","Yet those who rely solely on strength cannot meet our lord."
"902ab48","No, that requires intelligence that matches such strength.
Only those who possess both may qualify!"
"1002b64d","First, I will measure that intelligence... I challenge you
to a battle of wits..."
"f02b4da","?!"
"e02b367","Heh heh...shocked? This clone technique is my pride and
joy... With two of these clones, I'll test you right here!"
"d02b1f4","...Now, allow me to explain the rules. First, each of us
three will ask a question..."
"402a3a9","Of these, only the real one will ask a question whose answer
is 9."
"302a236","If you figure out which problem's answer is 9 and discover
the real me, the clones disappear, and you fight me alone."
"6006818","However, if you were to be tricked by a false question whose
answer isn't 9, and you mistake the clone for me..."
"700698b","You will be forced to fight me AND the clones...all three of
us! Now then, show me your stuff!"
"2ae410d","Now then, here is a question."
"ffae3cb4","The following numbers follow a special rule. What is the X?
""2  3  5  7  X  13"""
"ae3e27","If X is 9, then this is the real me. If not...a clone."
"fdae396e","What is your answer?"
"feae3ac1","The answer isn't nine! You're a clone!
The answer is nine! It IS the real you!"
"fbae3608","...In that case, ask one of the other ones for their question."
"fcae37fb","...Incorrect."
"f9ae3322","According to this rule, the answer for X is 11!"
"faae3495","As promised, you will fight all three of us!"
"3a7b92a0","Now then, here is a question."
"3d7b9779","X sheets to the wind. Two's company, X's a crowd. X strikes
and you're out. What do you get if you add up all the Xs?"
"3c7b9586","If X is 9, then this is the real me. If not...a clone."
"3f7b9a5f","What is your answer?"
"3e7b98ec","The answer isn't nine! You're a clone!
The answer is nine! It IS the real you!"
"417b9da5","...In that case, ask one of the other ones for their question."
"407b9c32","Splendid! You are correct!"
"437ba08b","All of these sayings have three in them...so when you add
them up, they equal nine!"
"427b9f18","As promised, my clones are no more...and I alone remain,
to engage you in battle!"
"410ddb7f","Now then, here is a question."
"420ddcd2","June is the 6th month, July is the 7th month, August is the 8th
month...and November is the Xth month."
"430dde45","If X is 9, then this is the real me. If not...a clone."
"3c0dd340","What is your answer?"
"3d0dd533","The answer isn't nine! You're a clone!
The answer is nine! It IS the real you!"
"3e0dd6a6","...In that case, ask one of the other ones for their question."
"3f0dd819","...Incorrect."
"480de664","November is the eleventh month of the year, so the answer
for X is 11!"
"490de7d7","As promised, you will fight all three of us!"
"26b414f2","I...I can't believe I lost..."
"25b4131f","Still, proper decision-making in the heat of battle relies
on one's intelligence..."
"24b411ac","I acknowledge both your intelligence and your strength!
You are worthy of meeting Lord Taomon!"
"23b41039","...Even so, to think I would lose this easily... I cannot
show my face to our lord..."
"d8026184","...Hey, you there! I have a serious matter I must ask you to
attend to."
"db02665d","I'm listening!
I refuse!"
"da0264ea","Thank you, kind one! It is a race against time. I need you
to stop that rampaging Digimon..."
"d5025ccb","That Digimon is Examon...one of the Royal Knights!"
"d4025b58","I don't know why, but this Digimon is running wild. If I was
at full power, I could put up a fight..."
"d7026011","...but I have just awoken, and it seems that foe is somehow
preventing me from replenishing my energy."
"d6025ebe","Examon should also be one of this world's protectors...
Well, whatever the reason...I need you to stop this rampage!"
"d102569f","Ugh...but you're the only one I can ask...!"
"20a2b67f","Examon is running wild here on Logic Volcano. Right around
the Flame Lands."
"21a2b7d2","If Examon leaves the mountain, who knows what'll happen?!
Please...stop this no matter the cost!"
"648eff2","You stopped Examon's rampage! We barely made it, huh. Still,
I wonder what was the cause of all that?"
"548ee1f","What...a fishbone...? Ha ha ha! Who would've thought?!"
"448ecac","If it ever happens again, I'll be that knight's opponent.
I'll think of it as a bit of exercise!"
"348eb39","Susanomon joined the city!"
"92b4520f","Hey, long time no see, {0}!"
"93b453e2","Oh, sorry if I freaked you out. Think of it as a bad joke."
"94b45555","I heard you used to be Tamer to a WarGreymon like me..."
"8db44a50","Now it's {1}, huh... I see.
Hey, won't you show me how strong you've gotten?"
"8eb44bc3","Alright, let's go!
Let me get ready..."
"8fb44db6","Okay, show me that power at once!"
"90b44f29","I see... Well do come back when you're ready!"
"56b98e94","You came back, {0}!
You're ready to fight with me?"
"59b9936d","Now! Show me {1}'s current power!"
"73dd1001","You're stronger than I imagined! For some reason that makes
me happy..."
"70dd0b48","It's just like when I was your partner, {0}..."
"71dd0d3b","Thank you, for even this can be called friendship. I would
like to join your comrades in the city. See you later!"
"76dd14da","WarGreymon joined the city!"
"a1630772","Hey, you! Yeah, you!"
"a063059f","That's a good look you've got there! You look like a real
veteran!"
"9f63042c","The name's BanchoLeomon! Fighting against strong opponents
is my way of life!"
"9e6302b9","Whaddaya say? You wanna trade some blows without saying
anything?"
"9d6300c6","Let's do it!
I can't right now!"
"9c62ff53","Such unwavering spirit, even faced with me! I bet we can
have a good fight!"
"9b62fde0","What?! Don't tell me you're scared? If not, please face me
next time we meet!"
"fb9931b1","You came back! I'll take you on this time..."
"f8992cf8","Fist to fist, as much as we want!"
"731c7904","Ha ha ha ha ha!
How refreshing!"
"761c7ddd","You're as good as I thought! What a spirited fight!
Interacting with our fists! Now we are true friends!"
"751c7c6a","As thanks for this fight, I will head to the city! See you
again, friend!"
"701c744b","BanchoLeomon joined the city!"
"33033418","So you're {0}..."
"360338d1","I see... You have this look only someone who saved the world
could have..."
"3503377e","Show that power to Omegamon, the one who governs the end..."
"38033c37","...and to Alphamon, the one who governs the beginning!"
"37033a44","Let's do it!
I can't right now!"
"3a033f1d","In this battle, our power can end your adventure, or your
power can give rise to a new adventure!"
"39033daa","I see...but we'll be around to fight you anytime!"
"e3ed6a33","You came, {0}!"
"e4ed6ba6","Now then, this time we'll take a look at that power!"
"643f50e6","Wonderful... We hope this power brings forth a new
adventure..."
"633f4f73","The day will surely come when our power will be needed..."
"623f4d80","When the time comes, do not hesitate to call on us... I can
see it, the moment we join forces!"
"693f5885","Omegamon and Alphamon joined the city!"
"2b420420","GWAAAAAR!!!"
"2e4208f9","...Nngh! Hey, you! Did you come to get in my way?!"
"2d420706","My body is being controlled by some unknown rage... I can't
control myself like this."
"30420bdf","Won't you move, human? I don't know what'll happen if you
don't!"
"2f420a6c","I'll do whatever it takes to stop you!
(I'm a little scared, let's back off for now...)"
"32420f25","Th...This anger... G...GWAAAAAR!!!"
"31420db2","Yes, run, human!"
"2592329b","Back, are you?! You can't stop my body filled with anger and
aggression!"
"2692340e","If you insist on staying, knowing this, then all this anger
and aggression will be directed at you!"
"fbc9202e","Hrrm? My anger...this heat...it's disappearing...?
This is...a fish bone...?"
"fac91ebb","I see, this was stuck in my throat...heh...ha ha ha ha!
This must come from the thousand fish I ate for strength."
"f9c91cc8","I'm sorry, human, but thanks to you my body is back to the
way it was. I can help you now!"
"c927cd","Examon joined the city!"
"6b5e0e9d","Ho ho ho...I've found you... {0}, was it?"
"685e09c4","I am Lilithmon, one of the Seven Deadly Digimon. You're the
one who saved this world, aren't you?"
"695e0bb7","I heard the rumor and wondered exactly what you're made of.
But you're such a scrawny runt... Color me unimpressed."
"665e06fe","I can't imagine you'd be able to satisfy me..."
"675e0851","Oh well...I'll let you fight me to kill some time."
"645e0398","...?"
"655e050b","...Jeez, you're thick! Looks like your brains need some
work, too... Fine, I'll make this simple: come fight me!"
"625e00b2","Let's do it!
I can't right now!"
"635e0225","Ho ho, let's dance! It's been a while since I fought...
I won't forgive any negligence on your part!"
"506022f3","How dull. I can't believe how dull you are..."
"e70c21be","You're back, {0}...still as scrawny-looking as
ever, huh. Now, will my words get through to you this time?"
"e60c1fcb","You'd better relieve my boredom, and fight me this time!"
"1be4f86b","Ho ho ho! How enjoyable, {0}! Quite different
from my vulgar battles with the other Deadly Digimon."
"1ce4f9de","You are quite interesting, human... Perhaps I can lend you
a little bit of help."
"1de4fbb1","Unlike the other Seven Deadly Digimon, I can be quite
accommodating... See you soon!"
"1ee4fd24","Lilithmon joined the city!"
"8005124e","Hmm, haven't seen your face around here...are you from the
Veggie Troops?!"
"7f0510db","I'm Agumon. I was asked by Leomon to guard the gate for the
Meaty Troops!"
"7e050f68","Don't you make fun of us meat-loving Meaty Troops! Eating
veggies alone would make your head spin, wouldn't it?"
"85051a6d","If you want to get past here, you'd better take me on!"
"840518fa","I don't really get it, but let's go!
I'll turn back for now..."
"83051707","You think you can beat me with that weak, veggie-fueled
body?! Face the power of meat, baby!"
"82051594","Leomon told me not to let you through!"
"af75e9ad","You again! It'll be the same no matter how many times you
come here! I'll never let a Veggie Trooper through!"
"ac75e4d4","I'll show you the power of meat! Yaaaargh!"
"45ba8c40","I lost! How could meaty power lose to veggie power?!"
"48ba9119","Wait...you're not with the Veggie Troops? You had no idea
the Meaty Troops and Veggie Troops were fighting each other."
"47ba8fa6","Hey, maybe that strength could help out the Meaty Troops...
Go talk to Leomon! I'm going to the city, so please help us!"
"4aba947f","Agumon joined the city!"
"5b28c4cb","Hey, you...have you seen my sandbag around?"
"5c28c6be","?"
"5d28c811","My name is Gaomon! I'm training sunup to sundown to get
ready for the boxing tournament!"
"5e28c984","But wouldn't you know it, I turn away for one second and my
precious sandbag gets stolen!"
"5f28cb77","...Well I say ""sandbag,"" but it was actually a hunk of meat.
Not surprising, considering the meat shortage around here..."
"6028ccea","But NOW what am I gonna do?! The tournament's around the
corner, and I need a hunk of meat!"
"6128ce5d","Say...could you bring me some hunks of meat? 20 should be
enough for everyone..."
"5228b6e0","Sure!
I have to keep going..."
"5328b853","Thanks a bunch! Please be quick about it, I need them in
time for the boxing tournament!"
"602b0b41","Oh, I see... I didn't realize... C'mon, guys! Which one of
you jerks stole my sandbag?!"
"771462d0","Bring 20 hunks of meat for use as sandbags!"
"7a1467a9","Please hurry, I need them in time for the boxing tournament!"
"c0dda7fd","You brought 20 hunks of meat?!"
"bddda324","Here's 20 hunks of meat!
I can't give them to you right now..."
"bedda497","You handed over 20 Hunks of Meat!"
"bbdd9fde","Ohhh yeahhhh!!! Thank you!!!"
"bcdda1b1","You know, the thing is with these hunks of meat...the more
I punch them, the softer and tastier they get!"
"b9dd9cf8","After an intense workout, I get back my stamina with that
tender meat! Two birds with one stone!"
"badd9e6b","Or at least I did... I've got some bad news.. The truth is,
the boxing tournament's been put on hold..."
"b7dd9992","The conflict between the Meaty Troops and the Veggie Troops
makes a tournament impossible...but I'm not giving up!"
"b8dd9b05","We can hold it once peace has been restored! Until then,
I won't let this meat go to waste!"
"25e08553","Oh, I know! Why don't I go to the city, too? There's
something I wanted to do there. Okay, see you later!"
"27e088b9","Gaomon joined the city!"
"26e086c6","I see...but you better hand some over next time, okay?!"
"931d7fa4","Hey hey hey!!! Hold up there!"
"961d847d","?"
"951d828a","You think you can get through here without permission from
yours truly? You've got some guts, don'tcha?!"
"901d7aeb","...Hmm? You're not from around here, are ya? All right,
lemme teach you a little something!"
"8f1d7978","I'm Goblimon! Everything from here on out is my turf, and
any intruders ain't gonna get off lightly!"
"921d7e31","But I'm not a demon, buddy...despite my looks, heh. I've got
my nice side, too, y'know?"
"911d7c5e","Money talks, but meat talks louder! Bring me 20 rotten
pieces of meat, and I'll let you through!"
"8c1d74bf","I'll bring it!
Never mind, then."
"8b1d72cc","Oh! You're a reasonable guy, aren't ya? Don't forget the 20
pieces of rotten meat."
"8e1b392e","Hmph! In that case, get outta here!"
"cf18431f","If you want past here...you know what to do, right?"
"d01844f2","Bring 20 pieces of rotten meat!"
"c9bd1492","Looks like you brought 20 pieces of rotten meat, huh?"
"c8bd133f","Here you go, 20 pieces of rotten meat!
I can't give them to you right now..."
"c7bd114c","You handed over 20 Rotten Meats!"
"c6bd0fd9","One, two, three...yep, 20 in all!
I got 20 pieces of rotten meat!"
"c5bd0e66","MmmMMM! This beyond-fermented stench! It's so, so inviting!"
"c4bd0cf3","This is some of the best rotten meat I've ever seen...
*sigh* I wonder how I'll cook this exquisite meat?"
"c3bd0b00","...Whoops! I got lost in dreams of rotten meat."
"d2bd22fd","Alright! You can go wherever you want now! I'm going back to
the city for a full-course rotten meat feast!"
"d1bd210a","Goblimon joined the city!"
"c4bace1c","Whoa now...you're looking down on me, aren't ya?! You best
hand over some of that rotten meat next time!"
"b0372fe1","Now hold on a minute! You know who I am, and you're still
trying to do as you please?"
"ad372b28","?"
"ae372c9b","You ain't gonna last long around here with that attitude,
buddy. You gotta go through the proper channels, dig?"
"b33734ba","...You acting like this has nothing to do with you? C'mon,
I ain't ever heard of no Cluelessmon, have you?"
"b437362d","Fine, here's the score! When I say ""proper channels,"" I mean
you gotta give proof of meat to me, boss of this tunnel!"
"b1373154","...What? You don't know what ""proof of meat"" is? That means
you gotta give me 20 of the best pieces of meat."
"b23732c7","Let's cut to the chase--20 Best Meats, bring 'em here!"
"a7372196","Okay, okay, I'll bring some!
What. In the world. Are you talking about?"
"a8372309","Nice! You're a good kid, ya know that? All right, bring me
those 20 Best Meats, PRONTO!"
"353a3ff7","What you say to me?? If you don't get it, then get lost!"
"560105a2","Maybe in time you'll change your mind about that proof of
meat, huh?!"
"550103cf","Don't space out, yo--bring those 20 Best Meats, and fast!"
"fc8ab76f","Looks like you brought 20 Best Meats, huh?"
"fd8ab8c2","20 Best Meats, coming right up!
Not yet..."
"fe8abab5","You handed over 20 Best Meats!"
"f78aafb0","Looks dee-ee-licious! I'm all raring to go! This proof of
meat...I like it, and I'll take it!"
"f88ab123","Feel free to go on ahead through my tunnel! I'm in a great
mood today, so I've got a gift for you!"
"f98ab296","You can be in charge of this tunnel in my stead!"
"fa8ab409","To be honest, all that stuff about ""proof"" and ""Best Meats,""
well...I didn't think you'd actually go through with it!"
"38ac254","Leomon might really blow a fuse at me... Still, I wanna eat
this meat..."
"48ac3c7","...Anyway, I leave this place to you! Later, dude!"
"808dc5f2","Tyrannomon joined the city!"
"7f8dc41f","Whoa now...you don't have any proof of me for me?! You best
hand over that Best Meat next time, you hear me?!"
"33e62312","Oh ho...it's you! The newbie that buttered up to Leomon and
started hanging out around here..."
"32e621bf","...Huh? What was that? You want to know where ShineGreymon
is? Don't be ridiculous!"
"31e61fcc","The info I finally got by outwitting my rival Leomon by
giving up the location of the Meaty Troops..."
"30e61e59","You don't expect me to tell Leomon's gofer, do ya?! Or are
you gonna force it outta me?"
"2fe61ce6","Ah well...fine, let's do this!
I give up..."
"2ee61b73","Tch, lookit this tough guy! You think you can beat me?!
You'll regret this!"
"2de61980","Hmph! You'd better shove off, before I toss you outta here!"
"9ac37151","Hey now... It doesn't matter how many times you come over
here."
"97c36c98","I'm not gonna tell a gofer like you where ShineGreymon is!
Or do you plan to force me to tell you?"
"fd468e24","Owww ow ow ow ow! I give, I give! Battle over!!! I'll tell
you ShineGreymon's location..."
"4692fd","Head to the Generator Prison Room...apparently it's being
used as some kind of energy source...?"
"ff46910a","Jeez, I can't believe I told you that info I worked so hard
to get...now I'll never get ahead in the Meaty Troops..."
"fa46896b","You're a tough one, I bet you're full of promise! Alright,
let's get along from here on out!"
"f94687f8","Ogremon joined the city!"
"787dedaf","I am Woodmon...the Digimon in charge of the Generator Prison
Room."
"797def02","...Huh? You want me to give back ShineGreymon? How do you
know about that? ...Wait, exactly how much do you know?!"
"7a7df0f5","Like our plan to fire the Rose Palace laser using solar
power stolen from ShineGreymon..."
"737de5f0","...Like about laying waste to the Meaty Troop Digimon and
Ohguino Wilderness? You know about all that?!"
"747de763","Uh, you just told me everything...you all right?
I'm...gonna pretend I didn't hear that."
"757de8d6","Why, you... Now that you know our secret, here's no way
I can let you leave!"
"767dea49","...Well then get out of here, right now!"
"2ea064b4","It's the shady human... I guess you DO want to stop our plan
to fire a laser powered by ShineGreymon..."
"31a0690d","...Like how we'll shoot a laser using ShineGreymon's solar
power, laying waste to the Meaty Troops and Ohguino?!"
"58697721","Wait a minute... Don't tell me you know about the real
mastermind behind this...?"
"55697268","The one enticing Rosemon to raze the Ohguino Wilderness so
we can develop the land afterwards...?"
"566973db","Bony Resort's Myotis...mon...!"
"5b697bfa","...!"
"5c697d6d","In that case, I can't stay here anymore. Farewell!"
"59697894","Woodmon joined the city!"
"e281e69e","I am Woodmon...the Digimon in charge of the Generator Prison
Room!"
"e181e52b","I cannot let anyone go past here without Lady Rosemon's
permission! Get out of here, right now!"
"ca274138","Hey you! What're you doing here?!"
"cd2745f1","I am Leomon, the leader of the Meaty Troops of the Ohguino
Wilderness."
"cc27441e","I came on behalf of GrapLeomon!
I have nothing to tell you."
"cf2748d7","What? You came on behalf of GrapLeomon! Did something happen
to my friend?!"
"ce274764","({0} explained what had happened.)"
"d1274c3d","I see... So GrapLeomon did all that, just to save me...
But hey, that doesn't mean I trust you yet!"
"d0274a4a","If your story is true, then you must know about our motto...
Go on, tell me what it is!"
"c3273633","""Nice to Meat You!""
""No Meat, No Digi-Life!""
""Say No To Meat Thieves!"""
"c2273440","I think I've heard that phrase before, but...sorry, that's
not the right one."
"c524faa2","This is not the time for jokes. Please go."
"c624fc15","Hmm... Close, but no cigar..."
"c324f75c","You cannot expect me to trust someone who messes up at such
an important time. Please calm yourself and come back again."
"c424f8cf","Ohh! Yeah, that's our motto! Okay, I can trust you, please
help us out in GrapLeomon's place!"
"c124f476","The truth is, us Meaty Troops and Rosemon's Veggie Troops
are clashing here in the Ohguino Wilderness..."
"c224f5e9","In a meat field in the corner of these vast wastelands,
Rosemon erected a structure known as the the Rose Palace..."
"bf24f110","Ever since that day, the Digimon of that area have
experienced a severe food shortage."
"c024f283","What's more, Rosemon's forces formed the Veggie Troops,
and have tried to expel us from these lands!"
"cd25071a","If this continues, all of the Digimon will be in grave
danger! We need your strength to help oppose this outrage!"
"ce25088d","I think you've got the broad strokes of what's going on now.
I know it's out of the blue, but...I have a request for you!"
"bf22b2b9","First, go see for yourself what this area is all about.
If you can, try and get some info out of the Veggie Troops!"
"be22b0c6","This place is full of hot-blooded Digimon... It'll be tough,
but we're counting on you!"
"9dd82353","We need you to understand more about the Ohguino Wilderness.
Try and get some info out of the Veggie Troops!"
"9ed824c6","It'll be tough, but we're counting on you!"
"9183af86","You've learned what's happening in the Ohguino Wilderness!"
"9083ae13","({0} explained everything that's happened.)"
"8f83aca0","Those damn Veggie Troops... I can't believe they're being
so cruel to the other Digimon..."
"9683b7a5","But thanks to your efforts, we know more about what they're
up to...their solidarity is weak! Surely we can prevail!"
"9583b632","That's why I need one more thing from you...our fellow
warrior ShineGreymon is currently missing."
"9483b45f","It sounds like the Veggie Troops have captured that brave
soul, but the location of their prison is unknown..."
"9383b2ec","Meaty Troops commando Ogremon seems to have found some
intel, but the oaf sees me as a rival, and won't tell me."
"9a83bdd1","Please talk to Ogremon, and get him to tell you where
they've taken ShineGreymon!"
"9983bc7e","Ogremon won't fess up easily, but we're counting on you!"
"1651f609","Please learn the location of ShineGreymon's prison from
Ogremon!"
"1351f1b0","Ogremon isn't one to give up without a fight, but we're
counting on you!"
"96a3dd3c","Oh! You've learned where they're keeping ShineGreymon?!"
"99a3e1f5","(You explained what you heard from Ogremon.)"
"98a3e002","What?! ShineGreymon is being held in the Generator Prison
Room, and is being used as some kind of energy source?"
"93a3d863","It's true that a massive amount of solar energy is contained
within ShineGreymon's body..."
"92a3d6f0","But what are those Veggie Troops planning to do with that
energy? Ugh...I have a bad feeling about this!"
"95a3db49","It'll be too late by the time we've figured it out! Please,
go to the Generator Prison Room and rescue ShineGreymon!"
"94a3d9d6","Security should be tight around there...don't take too long,
but make sure you're well-prepared!"
"5988f257","Go to the Generator Prison Room and rescue ShineGreymon!"
"5a88f3ca","Security should be tight around there... Make sure you're
well-prepared!"
"dc1bfe6a","Oh! You succeeded in rescuing ShineGreymon?!"
"db1bfcf7","({0} explained everything that's happened.)"
"da1bfb04","I see... ShineGreymon must have been exhausted..."
"d91bf991","That damn Rosemon! To think they plan to burn down all of
the Ohguino Wilderness with a laser!"
"d81bf83e","We have to stop that plan, no matter what it takes!"
"d71bf64b","But just in case, let's evacuate the Digimon around here!
I'll stay here and direct things!"
"d61bf4d8","Please head to their headquarters in the Rose Palace, and
prevent them from firing that laser!"
"d51bf365","The Ohguino Wilderness, and the lives of all the Digimon who
live here, are counting on you! Good luck!"
"45156dd","I want you to head to the Rose Palace, and prevent Rosemon
from firing that laser!"
"1515204","The Ohguino Wilderness, and the lives of all the Digimon who
live here, are counting on you! Good luck!"
"e6e36730","You stopped Rosemon from firing the laser? That's amazing!"
"e9e36b89","Our long battle is finally over...and peace has once again
returned to this land..."
"e8e36a16","All of this is thanks to your hard work! The Meaty Troops...
no, all of us Digimon in the Ohguino Wilderness thank you!"
"ebe36eef","You are truly the savior of all meat...and our friend!"
"eae36d7c","Now that I think about it, former allies and enemies are
working together in Floatia, aren't they?"
"ede37235","The battle between the Meaty and Veggie Troops was indeed
intense, but in a way it made all of us stronger..."
"ece37042","In that sense, the battle may not have been for nothing...
Yeah...of course I'll come help!"
"efe3751b","Leomon joined the city!"
"3149a3f5","Hmm? What do you want with me?"
"2e499f3c","Wizardmon wants you to come back to the city.
Nothing, nothing at all."
"2f49a0af","What, Wizardmon said that? We haven't talked in ages, so
this is a bit out of the blue..."
"2c499bd6","We traveled the world looking for magic ingredients
together, and it was a blast...a bit hairy at times, though."
"2d499d49","Oh! Maybe this is why Wizardmon couldn't contact me!
It's a magic-blocking stone!"
"2a4998f0","Do me a favor and keep this a secret from Wizardmon, yeah?
Alright, off to the city! Later!"
"2b499a63","Garurumon joined the city!"
"3849aefa","Nothing, you say... You sure you're not hiding something?"
"3949b06d","Ah well, maybe I don't want to know..."
"d4dbbe5f","...What's your deal, man? You came to steal the veggies from
these fields?"
"d5dbc032","These are special, man! They grow vegetables eaten by THE
Lady Rosemon!"
"d6dbc1a5","This is no place for a nobody like you to tread, see!"
"cfdbb6a0","Got it? Scram before you get hurt!"
"d0dbb813","Don't go monopolizing veggies!
(Let's head back for now...)"
"d1dbb986","All veggies from these fields are for Lady Rosemon alone! I
got no right to give them to anyone else in the first place!"
"d2dbbb79","Heh! Don't come around these parts again, got it?!"
"6ca1e9e4","Why, you... How many times must I say it? These fields are
special, they grow the veggies eaten by Lady Rosemon!"
"6fa1eebd","It's no place for a suspicious person like you to be!"
"365dde11","...Jeez, alright already! This is ridiculous. I can't take
it anymore!"
"335dd958","I thought monopolizing all these fields and buttering up to
Rosemon would let me live the high life..."
"345ddacb","It ain't worth all this, though! Ah well...maybe I'll see
what's banging in the city, heh!"
"395de2ea","Vegiemon joined the city!"
"8b03f8e","I grow vegetables for Rosemon here! That means they're
S-P-E-C-I-A-L, SPECIAL, got it?!"
"7b03e1b","Grrr, g'wan, get outta here already!"
"fc628182","Uuugh...my stomach's sticking to my Digi-ribs, here...
hey you, help a 'mon out..."
"fb62802f","What's wrong?
Sorry, can't right now."
"fa627ebc","Y'see, up till recently I was growing delicious vegetables
in the fields of the Palace of Thorns..."
"f9627cc9","But that jerk Vegiemon has taken control of all the veggie
fields to curry favor with Lady Rosemon."
"f8627b56","Since then, the rest of us have had so little to eat,
it's just awful..."
"f76279e3","Defecting to the Meaty Troops would be bad for Lady Rosemon,
but...at this rate, we'll starve to death!"
"f6627870","Someone's gotta teach Vegiemon a lesson and take back those
fields! Please, you've gotta do it!"
"5628fed","Oh... I see... Urgh, my poor stomach..."
"8432c841","Take back the Palace of Thorns' fields from Vegiemon!
Please...hurry..."
"8132c388","Ahhh... I'm so hungry..."
"670f46d4","Hooray! You showed Vegiemon who's boss! Now everyone can
eat their fill of these yummy vegetables!"
"6a0f4bad","But now we're just back in the fight with the Meaty Troops.
You know, I was thinking..."
"690f4a3a","Becoming your ally is sure to end this fight sooner, right?
That's why I'll support you from the city!"
"640f421b","Lillymon joined the city!"
"9b43c691","IT IS I, HERCULESKABUTERIMON..."
"9843c1d8","BEYOND THIS POINT IS LADY ROSEMON'S ROOM..."
"9943c34b","NONE MAY PASS!"
"9e43cb6a","AND I SHALL SOUNDLY TROUNCE YOU IF YOU ATTEMPT TO PASS!"
"9f43ccdd","You won't trounce me! Bring it!
(Let's back off...)"
"9c43c804","BE WARNED THAT I AM QUITE TENACIOUS! I SHANT BE DEFEATED!!!
NO HARM SHALL BEFALL LADY ROSEMON!!!"
"9d43c9f7","THIS IS ROSEMON'S PALACE! GO, AND NEVER RETURN!!!"
"34667852","YOU RETURNED, DESPITE MY WARNINGS! BEYOND THIS POINT IS LADY
ROSEMON'S ROOM... YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!"
"336676ff","AND I SHALL SOUNDLY TROUNCE YOU IF YOU ATTEMPT TO PASS!"
"39c1a6df","...UGH...WHAT...WHAT WAS I DOING...?"
"3ac1a8b2","I SEE. I WAS UNDER ROSEMON'S SPELL... HOW EMBARRASSING. "
"3bc1aa25","I SUPPORT NEITHER THE MEAT NOR THE VEGGIE FACTIONS...
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY YOU END THIS CONFLICT."
"34c19f20","HerculesKabuterimon joined the city!"
"5f8ab300","IT IS I, HERCULESKABUTERIMON..."
"628ab7d9","NONE MAY PROCEED PAST THIS POINT! BEGONE WITH YOU!"
"eb1c1094","It's about time you showed up. You're that human siding with
the Meaty Troops and mucking up my plans..."
"ee1c156d","Well, too late! With the energy harvested from ShineGreymon,
the laser's ready to fire on the Ohguino Wilderness!"
"ed1c13fa","Those savage Meaty Troops and all of the Wilderness will go
up in flames! But it's no fun in firing it right away..."
"e81c0bdb","I know! I'll give you one last chance... Fight me, and try
to stop me from firing the laser cannon!"
"e71c0a68","You read my mind, Rosemon!
Just...gimme a second..."
"ea1c0f21","Ho ho ho... I'll get rid of you before I take down those
Meaty Troop fools!"
"e91c0d4e","Your fear has gotten the better of you, has it? Very well...
I can wait a little while longer!"
"2716d40f","You finally came back... If you don't hurry, I might change
my mind and fire the laser right here and now, you know?"
"2816d5e2","Now then... Fight me, and try to stop me from firing the
laser cannon!"
"806f4b42","Ugh...it can't be...! If it's come to this, I'll hypnotize
you..."
"7f6f49ef","...Gasp! It doesn't work on you!!! I see...the human, and
that partner, you're...!"
"7e6f487c","...You have triumphed, Tamer. As promised, I will...stop
the laser..."
"7d6f4689","...It's not like I hate the Meaty Troops anyway, and I could
care less about winning this war..."
"7c6f4516","Thank you for stopping me. Being queen of this castle was
fun, if only for a while."
"7b6f43a3","... ... ..."
"7a6f4230","In exchange for this castle, I fell for that guy's smooth
talk. Ahh, this defeat feels like freedom! I'm so refreshed."
"896f59ad","Next I'll try going to the city! I can't wait to see what
awaits me in that new place."
"886f583a","Oh, ""that guy""? Give my regards to Myotismon the next time
you meet, okay?"
"7b6d04cc","Rosemon joined the city!"
"368df4fb","You there... Please listen to my tale of woe..."
"378df66e","?"
"388df7c1","Lately, I have not been able to sleep..."
"398df9b4","I have nothing keeping me up at night...but still..."
"3a8dfb27","I cannot sleep... You are a Tamer, yes? Do you know anything
about sleep in relation to Digimon?"
"3b8dfc9a","Perhaps a tool that could help me sleep... Would you know
anything about that?"
"3c8dfe0d","Hmm...how about I look for something?
Have you tried counting sheep?"
"2d8de690","You have my thanks... I'll leave it to your judgment."
"2e8de803","Some strange device may exist within Rosemon's palace..."
"3b903b71","Sheep...? I shall not rely on superstitions..."
"7ff5d800","Have you found a tool that could help me sleep?"
"82f5dcd9","Some strange device may exist within Rosemon's palace..."
"bd72246d","You got Rosemon's favorite(?) Virtual Memory Foam Pillow!"
"54d19d52","You found a useful sleeping aide, have you?"
"53d19bff","You handed over the Virtual Memory Foam Pillow!"
"52d19a0c","A pillow...an object humans use when they sleep, huh?"
"51d19899","Hmm, I lay it under my head...like this...? To think some
people sleep like thi--"
"50d19726","Oh...this fragrance! This is Rosemon's reputed hypnotic
scent!"
"4fd195b3","Yes, this will certainly help me slumber. You have sound
judgment, human!"
"4ed193c0","Human wisdom...what an unfathomable thing... Hmm, it seems
I must continue to associate with all of you."
"5cd1a9ca","Antylamon joined the city!"
"74de593e","Ohhh... Hey, did you...did you save me?"
"73de574b","I don't know who you are, but I'm so grateful... Still, why
did you come to save me in the first place?"
"72de55d8","({0} explained the situation.)"
"79de60dd","I see... While I've been captured, such a fate has befallen
this Ohguino Wilderness..."
"78de5f6a","*huff huff* My body...something's wrong...
Am I...out of energy?!"
"77de5df7","?!"
"76de5c04","It seems that the solar energy in my body was drained by
this device during my imprisonment..."
"6dde4e39","Now I get it... Those Veggie Troop fools mean to use the
stolen energy to fire a laser..."
"6cde4c46","There's not a lot of time before the cannon fires... Sorry
to ask, but please return to Leomon and ask for his advice."
"efdb4928","My beloved Ohguino Wilderness is in danger. I wish I could
fight with you, but this body would only get in your way..."
"f0db4a9b","Sorry to ask right after you rescued me...but for the sake
of restoring peace to this land, lend us your strength!"
"f1db4c0e","I see, you stopped them from firing the laser! Please, go
tell Leomon at once!"
"f930461d","...Oh, it's you! Thanks for all your help in that battle
against the Veggie Troops."
"f6304144","See, the thing is...my body took a lot of damage from having
all that solar energy drained out of it by that device..."
"f7304337","But thanks to all your hard work, peace has returned to
these Ohguino Wilderness..."
"f4303e7e","That is why I can end my watch over the Wilderness without
worry, and heal myself with this warm light shining down..."
"f5303fd1","Oh yes... I haven't thanked your properly yet...okay, I'll
make you a promise here and now!"
"f2303b18","Just wait a little longer... Once this body of mine is back
in good health, I'll join the city and lend you my support!"
"dbc25670","You remember the promise I made to you, right?"
"dec25ac9","Just wait a little longer... Once this broken body is back
to normal, I'll join the city and lend you my support!"
"b5f949cf","...Oh, it's you! Thanks for all your help in that battle
against the Veggie Troops."
"b6f94ba2","See, the thing is...my body took a lot of damage from having
all that solar energy drained out of it by that device..."
"b7f94d15","But thanks to all your hard work, peace has returned to
this Ohguino Wilderness..."
"b0f94210","That is why I could end my watch over these wastelands
without worry, and heal myself in this warm sunlight..."
"b1f94383","Please allow me to thank you again!"
"b2f94576","And now I go to the city, to lend you my strength!"
"b3f946e9","ShineGreymon joined the city!"
"5e52764d","Dee hee! Say, man, you like treasure? I bet you do!"
"5b5271f4","?"
"5c527367","The truth is, a great pirate of the Digi-seas finally wound up
here after his last voyage!"
"59526eae","According to legend, the captain retired from the seas, and
lives here to this day..."
"5a527001","There's a super-valuable Holy Chalice hidden somewhere
around here! That's where you come in, buddy..."
"57526b48","Would you look for the Holy Chalice? We can sell it and
split the profits 50/50!"
"58526d3b","Sure!
I have to keep going..."
"55526862","Dee hee hee! Sounds like you get the picture. So get this,
I heard that the Holy Chalice was actually hidden..."
"565269d5","...stashed away by this crazy-strong Digimon pirate captain
by the name of Vikemon..."
"43548aa3","Aw c'mon, you can't pass up a story like this, can ya?!"
"66a6e3ee","The former pirate captain Vikemon is somewhere here in
MOD Cape."
"65a6e27b","I want to lay my peepers on that treasure, the Holy Chalice!"
"906ff65b","Dee hee hee! Did ya find the Holy Chalice?"
"916ff7ce","You handed over the Holey Chalice!"
"926ff9a1","Huh? What's this worn-out thing? ...Don't tell me this is
the Holy Chalice?"
"936ffb14","(You related Vikemon's trip down memory lane.)"
"946ffc87","Aww maaaan, the great pirate Vikemon, of all people, thinks
of memories as treasures?!"
"956ffe7a","What a crazy romantic! But I guess that's pirates for you...
completely out of touch with reality."
"966fffed","*sigh* There go my dreams of living on easy street...
Ah well, I'll see what moolah I can scrounge up in the city."
"876fe870","DemiDevimon joined the city!"
"a7c92397","Hey! Hey, you! You look like a pretty good fisherman!"
"a8c9250a","?"
"a9c926fd","I'm Seadramon! I want to open a fishing hole in the city,
but..."
"a2c91bf8","The fish I'm raising to start with aren't nearly enough..."
"a3c91d6b","That's where an awesome fisherman like you comes in...
I want you to catch me a bunch of fish!"
"a4c91ede","I'll need some Digifry, Digicrucian and Digikoi! What do you
say, will you help me?"
"a5c920b1","A bunch of fish, coming up!
I'm not that good at fishing..."
"9ec9154c","You'll angle them for me?! Alright, let me tell you those
fish I need again, just in case!"
"9fc9173f","A Digifry, Digicrucian and Digikoi! One of each will do.
Thanks in advance!"
"accb6a2d","Oh yeah? Well come on back if you get better at fishing!"
"e4e40e7c","I need you to catch three kinds of fish for my fishing hole!"
"e7e41335","A Digifry, Digicrucian and Digikoi! One of each will do.
Thanks in advance!"
"64922749","Oh hey! You caught some Digifry, Digicrucian and Digikoi
for me?!"
"619222f0","Here's the Digifry, Digicrucian and Digikoi!
Now's not a good time..."
"62922463","You handed over the Digifry, Digicrucian and Digikoi!"
"67922c02","Great! These plucky little dudes are of good stock. Now I
can open up the fishing hole I've always wanted!"
"68922df5","Oh, right! I have to thank you for catching all those fish
for me. Take this!"
"6592293c","You got a Feather Lure!"
"66922aaf","A fisherman like you can make good use of this baby!"
"6b92324e","Come hang out once I've opened my fishing hole in the city!
I'll have all kinds of specimens waiting for you!"
"6c923421","Seadramon joined the city!"
"e995375f","That's too bad... Well, come on back whenever you want!"
"41e9d55a","Oh, you're the...human people talk about, right? For some
reason, you take on requests from us Digimon."
"40e9d3e7","Leave it to me!
Little busy right now..."
"3fe9d274","Oh hey, awesome. I'm ExVeemon! I've been looking for a
certain Digimon for a while now."
"3ee9d081","Have you ever heard of Magnamon?"
"3de9cf2e","He's a Royal Knight clad in brilliant golden armor! He
should have finally appeared somewhere in this world."
"3ce9cdbb","He is a legendary being without parallel. I've looked all
over, but haven't been able to find him."
"3be9cbc8","If I ever met him, I'd want his autograph! That's why if YOU
get a chance to meet him, please get one for me!"
"3ae9ca55","As for where he could be, well...I've looked everywhere, and
just about given up."
"39e9c8e2","First I'd recommend going to Veedramon and see what he says.
He's been looking for Magnamon, too."
"3ce78ec4","Veedramon should be in Absolute Zero. Go find him!"
"3de790b7","I see. Well, if you ever have some free time, come on back!"
"888a9d39","Ask Veedramon in Absolute Zero where you can find Magnamon."
"858a9860","I imagine it'll be tough, but please, you gotta do it!"
"79f4f6c","Were you able to meet with Veedramon? You can trust any info
that comes from him."
"a9f5425","...Huh? But will Magnamon give me his autograph, you ask?
Hmm...well, do something to get it, would ya?"
"b13f4d43","...Oh wow, you really did it!"
"b23f4f36","You handed over Magnamon's Autograph!"
"b33f50a9","Huh? He's got a message for me? Whoa, that's awesome!"
"b43f521c","..."
"b53f538f","Oh, I see. Just getting an autograph from my idol won't make
me strong like Magnamon... That's his advice, huh?"
"b63f5562","I understand, I was going about things the wrong way.
This experience has taught me that."
"b73f56d5","I'll go to the city, too, and work to become a Digimon
others can look up to. Please tell Veedramon and Magnamon!"
"b83f5848","ExVeemon joined the city!"
"df823c4a","I'm Stingmon. I see you're the type that can't pass up
problems."
"de823ad7","You wouldn't just reject my request, would ya?"
"dd823964","What is it?
Laaame..."
"dc8237f1","Just as I thought. All right, listen up."
"db82361e","I want you to deliver my letter to a certain Digimon.
Now hold on, I know what you want to say."
"da8234ab","Normally you can just get by with a DigiMail, right?"
"d9823338","See, I want to contact MegaKabuterimon, but no matter how
many DigiMails I send, I never get a reply."
"d8823145","This started one day without warning...plus he's always
traveling, so he never settles on one place..."
"d7822fd2","Well, that's the deal. That's why I have to ask a
trustworthy globe-trotter like you."
"da7ff634","You got Stingmon's Letter!"
"db7ff7a7","There's no rush, but if you run into MegaKabuterimon, please
hand over that letter."
"dc7ff91a","Please don't open it, though. It's a letter, not a telegram,
all right?"
"dd7ffa8d","Sorry, I know you wouldn't do something like that..."
"d67fef88","All right, with this all of my regrets are gone. Guess I'll
head back to Floatia..."
"d77ff17b","What, you're calling all us Digimon back to Floatia?!
Perfect, I'll head right on over."
"d87ff2ee","Stingmon joined the city!"
"d97ff441","Oh. I guess like I misread you. Don't worry about it."
"99b8fde9","I'm Stingmon. I see you're the type that can't pass up
problems."
"96b8f910","You wouldn't just reject my request, would ya?"
"97b8fa83","What is it?
Laaame..."
"9cb902a2","Just as I thought. Well then, I'll get right on it..."
"9db90415","...Oh wait, you can't right now. Sorry, but can you make
some room in your inventory?"
"9ab8ff5c","Please come back when you do, if you could."
"9bb900cf","Oh. I guess like I misread you. Don't worry about it."
"3aa52547","...Hey you, can you show me your partner Digimon for a sec?"
"3ba5273a","Hmm hmm hmm...this aerodynamic form reduces drag, and
increases attack speed, huh..."
"3ca528ad","Oh, how rude of me...I am AeroVeedramon. I'm researching
Digimon forms and functions!"
"35a51da8","I have a favor to ask about that. In order to gather some
research data, could I battle your partner Digimon?"
"36a51f1b","If it helps with your research!
Sorry, can't right now..."
"37a5208e","Oh! You'll accept my request! I want some extremely accurate
data! Come at me at full power!"
"38a52261","That is unfortunate... Well then, I'll try asking at the
next opportunity..."
"d6918cec","You've come back!"
"d99191a5","Would you allow me to battle your Digimon today, to get data
for my research...?"
"577cdab9","Okay, okay! That's enough! Thanks to you, I have acquired
more than enough data!"
"547cd5e0","Still...the movements of your Digimon cannot be explained by
my hypothesis..."
"557cd753","Perhaps...I have stumbled upon some new research data! Oh,
and I heard there's a research lab in the city, yes?"
"5a7cdf72","Okay, I'll go get a detailed analysis of this precious data!
You have my heartfelt thanks for helping me acquire it!"
"5b7ce0e5","AeroVeedramon joined the city!"
"d4c34adc","...Say, you there! Wouldja listen to my story for a minute?"
"d7c34f95","I'm all ears!
Sorry, now's not a good time..."
"d6c34e22","I appreciate it, pal! The thing is, I've been thinking about
heading to Floatia sometime soon..."
"d1c34603","But before I do, something's been nagging at me...
It's about my apprentice, Gumdramon..."
"d0c34490","A real conceited brat, that Digimon! He never listens, so I
went and popped him one!"
"d3c34969","He called me an idiot and ran off...haven't seen him since.
I've got a short fuse, too, so...my hand moved on its own..."
"d2c347f6","So do me a favor, would you go apologize to him for me?
He should be at Logic Volcano..."
"ddc35927","Hmph... Yer made of ice, ya know that?!"
"966b2bf7","Go apologize to my apprentice Gumdramon for me!"
"976b2d6a","He should be at Logic Volcano... Thanks for going out of
your way for me like this!"
"7a84de8a","Oh-hoh! You told Gumdramon I was sorry?! ...Huh, so that
punk felt bad about the whole thing too, did he?"
"7984dd17","...What? He said he's gonna go wait for me in the city?!
Lookit this guy, going the extra mile!"
"7884dba4","I made you worry too, didn't I, buddy? ...my bad. Master and
apprentice will be back together in no time! Peace out!"
"7784da31","Zudomon joined the city!"
"97fb8699","Well now, we've got ourselves a human here! What're you
doing around these parts?"
"94fb81c0","The name's Vikemon... I used to go around causing trouble,
but these days I'm out of the game..."
"95fb83b3","You were a great pirate captain, right?
If this story's gonna take a while I'll come back later..."
"9afb8b52","Ah HA, I get it. You came to ask about the pirate treasure,
am I right?"
"9bfb8cc5","Sorry to disappoint, but I split all my treasure among my
crew when we disbanded. There's not a Digi-doubloon left."
"98fb880c","Now I enjoy a life of catching fish and living off the sea.
There's nothing left... Well, that is..."
"99fb89ff","Ha ha ha! Yes, there's that... If you beat me, I'll tell you
what I mean!"
"9efb919e","Sure, go home if you're done here. There's nothing for you
here, y'see."
"5c2e2f3a","Argh, avast, avast! I give, playtime's over."
"5b2e2d47","I'm a 'mon of my word! I'll tell you about the treasure."
"5a2e2bd4","This chalice here...it's probably the source of the rumor
about some ""Holy Chalice."""
"592e2a61","?"
"582e288e","During my pirate days, I'd hold feasts every night with the
other sailors, drink my fill from this chalice, and go nuts!"
"572e271b","That's why this here chalice, filled to the brim with such
fond memories, is my treasure...my ""holy chalice""..."
"562e25a8","Heh heh, you must think that's pretty silly. Here, take this
as a symbol of your victory over me."
"552e2435","You got a Holey Chalice!"
"542e2242","No point in indulging in those memories anymore... I'll take
this opportunity to turn over a new leaf!"
"572be8a4","I still have plenty to teach those young'uns out there.
Ha ha ha, what 'til they get a load o' me!"
"582bea17","Vikemon joined the city!"
"5f80b27","Well now, we've got ourselves a human here! What're you
doing around these parts?"
"6f80c9a","The name's Vikemon... I used to go around causing trouble,
but these days I'm out of the game..."
"7f80e0d","You were a great pirate captain, right?
If this story's gonna take a while I'll come back later..."
"f80308","Ah HA, I get it. You came to ask about the pirate treasure,
am I right?"
"1f804fb","Hey, first let me teach you something good."
"2f8066e","If you're gonna hunt for buried treasure, better have a
place to put it first. That's one of the basics, kid! Ha ha!"
"3f807c1","Sure, go home if you're done here. There's nothing for you
here, y'see."
"8a5205a6","Who're you? You look greedy..."
"89520433","You got something to say to MegaSeadramon?"
"88520240","I want your Fishy Picture...
Who, me? Nope..."
"8f520d45","What?! You want my Fishy Picture?! Are you funnin' me, son?!"
"8e520bd2","A Fishy Picture's something you get from fish, right?
I ain't a fish, I'm a Digimon!"
"8d520a7f","And not any old Digimon, either. Among sea dragon types, I'm
an elite Perfect Digimon!"
"8c52088c","You'd do best to remember..."
"935213f1","(You talked about Gomamon.)"
"9252121e","Gomamon! Huh... I got no idea what that squirt is
thinking..."
"854fbf10","Still, it's not like I can ignore the kid. And besides,
you went and made a promise to him."
"864fc083","Let's see, what to do... Hm, I've got just the ticket."
"874fc276","This ancient illustration has been handed down in my clan
for generations. My ancestor drew it millennia ago."
"884fc3e9","Looks pretty awful, doesn't it? To be honest, I really don't
see the value in it. Here, it's all yours."
"894fc55c","You got the MegaSea Fishy Picture!"
"8a4fc6cf","It may seem like I'm tricking the kid, but don't worry.
I'll explain the truth next time I meet Gomamon."
"8b4fc8a2","I'll be waiting in the city. You should invite Gomamon, too.
That'd be good for you, wouldn't it?"
"8c4fca15","I'm pretty knowledgeable when it comes to fish, heh heh.
I'm sure it'll help you out!"
"8d4fcb88","MegaSeadramon joined the city!"
"8e4fcd7b","What the heck... If you ain't got no business with me, then
shove off!"
"a9069745","Who're you? You look greedy..."
"a606928c","You got something to say to MegaSeadramon?"
"a706947f","I want your Fishy Picture...
Who, me? Nope..."
"a4068fa6","What?! You want my Fishy Picture?! Are you funnin' me, son?!"
"a5069119","You can't hold any more items and you want my Fishy Picture?"
"a2068c40","I don't got nothing to say to you. Shove off! Next time,
save a little space in your inventory."
"a3068e33","What the heck... If you ain't got no business with me, then
shove off!"
"f6a228a3","Hey! That Digisalmon... did you get it in the waters around
here? Digisalmon have been hard to find in this sea lately."
"f7a22a16","You fish quite a bit, don't ya?! MetalSeadramon don't play
nice with people who mess up the ocean!"
"f8a22b89","You've got the wrong guy!
Sorry, sorry!"
"f9a22d7c","What? You're feigning ignorance?!"
"faa22eef","Then what're you holding on to that Digisalmon for?! You're
gonna eat it, aren't you?!"
"fba23042","No more excuses, I've got all the proof I need."
"fca23235","Let's put it to the test! If you don't come around here,
the Digisalmon population should return to normal!"
"fda233a8","...I won't let you do any more fishing! All right, now get
outta here!"
"e691d48","Urrgh, what'd you say?! But if it's not you, then who..."
"11692201","...?"
"106920ae","Ha ha ha! I see, it was my mistake!"
"13692567","...!"
"126923f4","Digisalmon have a complicated ecology. Every few years they
migrate around oceans on a massive scale."
"1569284d","That must be what's happening now. Sorry, I've been asleep
for a while, so I'm a bit out of it."
"146926da","I'm sorry. It's hardly compensation, but take this thing I
found on the sea floor."
"7691243","You got a Platinum Poop Medal!"
"66910d0","Hmm, but y'know, there's a reason I'm out of it. Ever seen I
woke up I've been gathering bits and pieces of info."
"966d732","It sounds like all sorts of things are in motion around the
world now. Maybe I should head to Floatia myself."
"a66d8a5","MetalSeadramon joined the city!"
"ab8bd5b5","Hey! That Digisalmon... did you get it in the waters around
here? Digisalmon have been hard to find in this sea lately."
"a88bd0fc","You fish quite a bit, don't ya?! MetalSeadramon don't play
nice with people who mess up the ocean!"
"a98bd26f","You've got the wrong guy!
Sorry, sorry!"
"a68bcd96","All those fish filling up your inventory... It'd be a joke
to make excuses in a condition like this, you know?"
"a78bcf09","Get out of here, or I can't be held responsible for what
happens next!"
"a48bcab0","If you want to make excuses, at least get rid of some items
first. Don't underestimate me, human."
"a58bcc23","...I won't let you do any more fishing! All right, now get
outta here!"
"e1cfe515","A Tamer accompanied by two Digimon that saved this
world... You must be {0}."
"decfe05c","I'm Beelzemon. They say I'm one of the Seven Deadly Digimon,
but...I hate being in groups."
"dfcfe1cf","Doing what I want on my own like this suits me just fine...
Heh, sorry... Just running my mouth here..."
"dccfdd76","Now, what I want is a bout with a warrior such as yourself.
What do you say...? Feel like a fight with me?"
"ddcfdee9","You got it! Let's rumble!
I can't fight right now!"
"dacfda10","You'll fight without even asking my reason. I like that
spirit! Okay, let's have some fun!"
"dbcfdb83","There is certainly a fated time for battle... Very well.
I'll wait here until that time..."
"2091c4b6","{0}... I was growing impatient..."
"1f91c2c3","Are you in the mood to fight this time...?"
"2e236c83","Heh heh... You're just as interesting as I'd imagined!"
"2f236e76","I, who fight alone, and you, who fight with two Digimon...
We do things differently, yet we seek the same strength."
"30236fe9","When's the last time I had such a satisfying bout...?
I thank you for accepting my request!"
"3123715c","Beelzemon joined the city!"
"17ed54cf","WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME?"
"18ed56a2","Please give me the Haguru Gear!
Nothing..."
"19ed5815","GUARDROMON ASKED YOU TO COME SEE ME, RIGHT?"
"12ed4d10","!"
"13ed4e83","A DIGIMAIL ARRIVED FROM GUARDROMON A LITTLE WHILE AGO..."
"14ed5076","I HAVE A VAGUE NOTION OF WHAT'S GOING ON."
"15ed51e9","HERE, TAKE IT."
"1eed6034","You got a Haguru Gear!"
"1fed61a7","IT SEEMS THAT GUARDROMON HAS A TASK OF GREAT URGENCY."

have been lowered!"

WILL BE THERE BEFORE YOU KNOW IT!"

something you're worthy of doing!"

sick kicks when ya see 'em?!"
"8e6a89b3","Awww I can't take it anymore, all these negative vibes
you're putting out are driving me nuts!"
"8d6a87c0","This is a pretty nasty accusation...
(This seems like it'd be annoying, let's get out of here...)"
"906a8c99","Oh ho! You're sounding just as cheeky as ever! I'll send
you packing!"
"8f6a8b26","You gonna run? C'mon, say something, punk!"

what's going on here?!"
"5ef1a5a1","Ugh, I don't get it! At times like this...best to make a
break for it!"
"5df1a3ce","Nanimon joined the city!"
"77dc1537","Ugh, it stinks! Like, really, really stinks! What is that
nauseating stench?"
"78dc16aa","...Ugh, it's you! You're the one giving off that awful
smell! Even a sewer wouldn't reek so badly..."
"79dc181d","It's enough to make one's nose go crooked! Not that I have a
nose, but still..."
"72dc0d18","...Anyway! Get out of here, and quick! Or maybe you wanna
whiff of my special fragrance here?!"
"73dc0e8b","I don't smell anything...
(I don't want that ""special fragrance"" on me... Let's jet!)"

I've had it! I'll chase you out myself!"

Seriously, what's wrong with you?!"

whiff of my special fragrance here?!"

"132c8490","Could it be that humans can't perceive smells?!"
"142c8603","I see, that's why you don't know you smell like a sewer...
Poor thing..."
"192c8e22","Still, if you insist on sticking around here, I'll be the
one to leave. Farewell!"

been standing there?"

(Just pretend like you didn't see anything...)"

Fault Ex Machina...rampaging anytime and any place."

actually gotten serious..."
"a1c81d68","I've stopped them time and time again, but I had to give up
to save myself. Still, maybe you can do something to help?"
"a0c81bf5","...Hmph, acting like you can't hear me, huh?"
"e3957e59","Please do something about this massive brawl between
MetalGreymon and MetalTyrannomon."

something!"

"da410f45","What...? You say I'm one of the reasons they were fighting?
They...didn't realize I was there...?!"
"d9410dd2","They're still mad, you say...? I'd better get while the
getting's good... Thanks for your help!"
"d4410633","MetalMamemon joined the city!"
"4827cb85","MetalTyrannomon! Let's end this, today!"
"4527c6cc","Fine. As long as there's no surprise attacks that's fine by
me! I'll turn you into scrap fair and square!"
"4627c8bf","What?! You're the one that loves surprise attacks, you jerk!
You gonna act like this wound on my heel ain't your fault?"
"4327c3e6","That's fresh, coming from you! Lookit this wound on my shin
and tell me your electronic brain ain't on the fritz!"
"4427c559","Wait! I was asked to mediate this fight!
(Maybe I shouldn't get involved...)"
"4127c080","Who the heck're you?! Outsiders should back off! If you plan
on getting in the way, I'll start by filling you with holes!"
"4227c273","Hey, you there! This ain't a spectator sport! Clear off if
you don't wanna get hurt!"
"fd3428e6","Not you again?! I told you this ain't a show! Don't get in
our way!"
"fc342773","If you don't want to get caught up in this fight, I suggest
you get lost! You won't make it out unscathed!"
"7ce24233","Ugh. Fine, fine, we'll call a truce! You say someone asked
you to step in?"
"7de243a6","Hmm, MetalMamemon, you say?! Jeez, why didn't he just come
himself?"
"7ee24519","Hmm... Hold on a sec...the height of this heel wound! And
now that I think about it, your shin wound..."
"7fe2468c","Could it be this wasn't a surprise attack from you, but an
injury I got when MetalMamemon tried to stop us?!"
"80e2487f","Yeah, he's so small we must not have noticed him! Sorry,
we'll head to the city after talking to him!"

They're pretty rare around these parts, y'see."
"ef7b755f","I wanted to show it off to my friends, but...before I knew
it, I'd lost it..."
"f07b7732","All right, I'll go look for it.
Sorry, can't right now."
"f17b78a5","For real?! Oh, but there's just one problem..."
"f27b7a18","The bridge connecting Pathfork Island to Boulder Island has
been down recently, so we can't go over there..."
"f37b7b8b","Pressing the switch in the Control Room should lower the
bridge..."

the bridge to Boulder Island?"
"ef7db436","I'll do something in return to thank you for your help!
Sorry for the hassle!"
"ee7db243","Oh?! I see. Hmm, that sucks..."
"17ca8cf8","Go find the cell phone I dropped on Boulder Island!"
"1aca91b1","First, drop the bridge to Boulder Island... The switch must
be in the Control Room."

been lowered!"

"fc8037b7","It looks like you lowered the bridge to Boulder Island.
Please look a bit more!"

"bb081cb5","You handed over Rapidmon's Cell Phone!"

going at full speed!"

requests at mach speed!"

I'll join you guys!"

"c1194eeb","Yeah!

"c0194d78","Great! Okay then, let's get started!"
"bf194b85","Man, what a downer.."
"80501829","Question #1!
What do they call this area?"
"7d501350","Bony Risotto
Bony Resort
Phony Resort"
"7e5014c3","You are correct! That was just a warm-up, the rest won't
be so easy!"
"83501ce2","BZZZT!!! WRONGOOOO!!!"
"84501e55","Sorry, but that's game over! You can try again anytime,
so come on back!"
"2057c2dc","Moving on to Question #2!

"2257c622","Correct again! Lookit the brainiac over here! Terriermon's

"1d57be03","BZZZT!!! Soooo wrong!"
"1c57bc90","That's all she wrote, buddy. But come back and try again!"

"541c37a6","You got every question right! Congratulations!"
"531c3633","As promised, we'll do anything you ask of us. What'll it be?"
"521c3440","Become a city resident!
Anything is okay, really."
"591c3f45","Will do! Since you asked so nicely, we'll join everyone in
the city!"
"581c3dd2","Anything's okay? In that case, we'll go join the city!"
"571c3c7f","It'll be fun hanging out with all the other Digimon there!"
"561c3a8c","Sounds like a plan, Stan! Next time we meet, it'll be in the
city! Byeee-byeee!"
"5d1c45f1","Terriermon and Lopmon joined the city!"
"9ed35118","Hey, you there. You came from the city, right? If so, maybe
you'll listen to my request."
"a1d355d1","I'm all ears!
Sorry, now's not a good time..."
"a0d3547e","I thought you'd say that!"
"a3d35937","I used to live in the city, you know. But some things
happened, so I set out on a magical quest."
"a2d35744","Now I'm about ready to head back, though. It's crazy out
here!"
"a5d35c1d","The thing is, I want you to tell Garurumon to head back to
the city, too."
"a4d35aaa","We have a certain contract, the two of us, but for some
reason I can't contact him. Would you relay the message?"
"97d34613","That's a shame... Sorry to hold you up. Still, if you change
your mind, please come talk to me!"
"4fbd8733","Garurumon should be in the Ohguino Wilderness."
"50bd88a6","If you spot him, tell him to come back to the city for me,
okay?"
"d00f6de6","Oh, looks like you spoke to Garurumon! Wonder why I haven't
heard from him...?"
"cf0f6c73","No matter. Time to head back to the old city, I suppose...
That Taomon's back too, isn't he?"
"ce0f6a80","His Taoist arts and my sorcery, I wonder which one is more
useful? I'll let you decide, heh heh."
"d50f7585","Wizardmon joined the city!"
"9346ef55","..."
"9046ea9c","...What're you doing in a place like this?
(...Just leave it be.)"
"9146ec0f","You found me!"
"8e46e7b6","I was playing hide-and-go-seek, see.
Well, ya got me!"
"8f46e929","It wouldn't end until you found me! Jeez, human games are
pretty weaksauce..."
"8c46e450","That's why I wanna play a new game! I'll go look for one in
the city!"
"8d46e5c3","Mamemon joined the city!"
"9a46fa5a","..."
"9b46fbcd","... (:_;)"
"f89fee6","Oh... It's you, is it? The human helping develop the city..."
"e89fd73","?"
"d89fb80","My name is Myotismon..."
"148a0685","I conduct all sorts of business with the goal of developing
each area, including the Bony Resort here..."
"138a0512","Yes... All sorts...hee hee! I thought I'd like to have a
pow-wow with you, just once."
"128a03bf","Everything you're doing is turning Floatia into a
fascinating place. I might even invest a bit myself."
"118a01cc","Anyway...business is business! Would you fulfil my request
as a condition of our deal?"
"188a0d31","Sure, I'm all ears!
Let me think about it..."
"178a0b5e","Right answer! Okay, I'll get to the point. There's but one
thing I desire..."
"a87b850","And that is my treasured parasol... My stolen Myobrella...
Please get it back!"
"b87b9c3","It's my favorite, you see... Without it, I just can't go out
during the day at my leisure."
"c87bbb6","The thief Turuiemon is at Logic Volcano... There's no time
to lose! Recover my Myobrella at once!"
"d87bd29","Yes, of course... There is a time and a place for business.
Do as you wish."
"5a7da185","Turuiemon, the one who stole my precious Myobrella, is at
Logic Volcano..."
"577d9ccc","Hurry up and retrieve my Myobrella at once!"
"de4de218","Ho ho ho... I see you retrieved my Myobrella from that jerk
Turuiemon!"
"e14de6d1","You handed over the Myobrella!"
"e04de57e","Yes, this is the one... Such elegance... Such craftsmanship.
Exquisite!"
"e34dea37","You've done well for me, human. True to my word, I shall
invest in your endeavors."
"e24de844","...Hmm? No need, you say? Well then, that's not very good
business, now is it?"
"e54ded1d","Well now let's see, you're gathering Digimon in Floatia, are
you not?"
"e44debaa","My presence in the city would be worth more to you than a
simple investment. Ho ho, perhaps business isn't your forte."
"d74dd713","The truth is, my original goal was to buy up works of art."
"d64dd5a0","This might be the right time to fulfill that dream. Time to
get started on my business! I'll cover the costs, of course."
"5a4ad3f5","Myotismon joined the city!"
"7bda21e3","Wow! Hey, yo! You lookin' REAL fly!"
"7cda2356","?"
"7dda24c9","Those items ya got... Ohhh I get it, you're that human!"
"7eda26bc","Ah, me? WereGarurumon's the name! Me, I like my items a
little flashy."
"7fda282f","I say items, but it's more like fashion, dig? Say, you know
what a SkullGrey Ring is?"
"80da2982","It's this must-have item SkullGreymon has, man! I just gotta
get my hands on it."
"81da2b75","I'll go ask for it!
What do I care about fashion?"
"82da2ce8","Duuuude, thank you thank you THANK you! You feel me, you
really feel me!"
"83da2e5b","SkullGreymon is in the Bony Resort. Try to haggle when you
find him, a'ight?!"
"dd31f9","For real? I thought you'd be all about this kinda stuff..."
"bfe02788","Get me a SkullGrey Ring from SkullGreymon!"
"c2e02c41","SkullGreymon's here in the Bony Resort.
You can do it, buddy!"
"5d02dff5","Wha'--HOW!!! You got a SkullGrey Ring?!"
"5a02db3c","You handed over the SkullGrey Ring!"
"5b02dcaf","AHH-WOO-WOO-WOOOOO! You're amazing, kid! Check it
out, this engraving right here is just DOPE, ain't it?!"
"5802d7d6","S got a real, y'know, skull-y grey-y feel to it, yeah?
It's perfect, just perfect..."
"5902d949","Whoops, my bad, dawg. Lookit me, yappin' away like a lil'
pup. I just gotta thank you, man!"
"5602d4f0","You and I, we know what's up when it comes to items, you
feel me? How 'bout we put this good taste to use in a shop?"
"5702d663","All right all right all right, let's do it! I'm gonna break
new ground in Floatia, just you wait!"
"6402eafa","WereGarurumon joined the city!"
"43d27e84","Oh...a human? You must've come from that ""city"" thing."
"46d2835d","My appearance doesn't upset you? How unexpected. Well, what
can I do for you?"
"45d281ea","Please give me a SkullGrey Ring!
Not a single thing!"
"40d279cb","A SkullGrey Ring? I guess I do have one of those..."
"3fd27858","I'm afraid I can't just give it away for free, though.
Of course, I'm not talking about money."
"42d27d11","Not a lot of people come up and talk to me, looking like I
do. I'm so bored!"
"41d27bbe","I want to do something to get the old motor running. That
work for you?"
"3cd2739f","Oh, okay... I don't understand you humans..."
"8c72d37f","Oof, I surrender! Okay, here's one ring. What do you plan
to do with this, exactly?"
"8d72d4d2","(You talked about WereGarurumon.)"
"8e72d645","Oh, WereGarurumon said that, did he? I would've been more
than happy to hand it over if he'd come himself."
"8772cb40","?!"
"8872cd33","I'm pretty particular myself when it comes to items. Who
wouldn't be happy to meet someone so like-minded?"
"8972cea6","Most folks run the other way when they see me, so I spent a
bunch of time doing arts and crafts by myself."
"8a72d019","I was getting pretty lonely here, to be honest... If someone
out there can understand me, I'll move on."
"9372de64","You got a SkullGrey Ring!"
"9472dfd7","Invite WereGarurumon along, too. Okay, I suppose I'll head
towards the city."
"917519f5","I'm a bit worried about whether I'll frighten people there,
but I'm sure it'll all work out!"
"90751802","SkullGreymon joined the city!"
"72190cf2","Oh...a human? You must've come from that ""city"" thing."
"71190b1f","My appearance doesn't upset you? How unexpected. Well, what
can I do for you?"
"701909ac","Please give me a SkullGrey Ring!
Not a single thing!"
"6f190839","A SkullGrey Ring? I guess I do have one of those..."
"6e190646","But, um...where exactly would you plan on putting it?"
"6d1904d3","To think you'd come here asking for an item with a full
inventory... You humans sure are a funny bunch."
"6c190360","Oh, okay... I don't understand you humans..."
"e26adbc1","Oh hey, you there! Come chat a bit, I gotta talk to ya!"
"df6ad708","?"
"e06ad8fb","I'm holding this recital I've always wanted to do here in
the city, and I was practicing to perfect my heavenly voice!"
"e56ae09a","But wouldn't ya know it, about thirty minutes into
rehearsal, tragedy struck poor ol' me!"
"e66ae20d","The battery! On my mic! It just plumb ran out! Out of the
blue, just...BZZT, and it's dead!"
"e36addb4","That's why I need ya to bring me a spare battery! This
beautiful voice just can't reach the fans without that mic!"
"e46adf27","That's just awful! You can count on me.
You're pretty loud as-is, do you really need a mic?"
"d96acdf6","Oh? You'll help me?! What a good little human you are!
I wasn't wrong when I picked ya out of the crowd!"
"da6acf69","This mic takes a Digi-Battery, ya dig? There should be more

"2d812ecf","You got a Digi-Battery!"
"534a3b70","Oh, it's you! And look at you, ya brought me back a battery
for my mic!"
"564a3fc9","You handed over the Digi-Battery!"
"554a3e56","Now let's see... I just put it right here, and..."
"584a432f","*ahem* Testing, testing, 1-2-3! Ohhh ohhh ohhh, come gimme

space yet, baby."
"594a4482","It's just 10 thou--oh, wait! I was just messin' around,

for me?"
"ea5dc82b","?"
"e95dc6b8","I've got more money than I know what to do with, and my
hobbies are just as gorgeous! And by that, I mean..."
"f05dd1bd","...objects made of platinum! Thanks to the power of money,
I've gathered many such objects..."
"ef5dcfca","But I lost my most precious item! Of course, I'm talking
about the one-of-kind Platinum Poop Medal!"
"ee5dce57","Without this, my platinum collection is incomplete! That's
why I want you to look for the Platinum Poop Medal!"
"ed5dcce4","Sure!
I have to keep going..."
"e45dbe99","Great! So you'll take my request! Still, I wonder where my
Platinum Poop Medal went to..."
"e35dbd26","I don't remember at all... I know it's an odd request, but
please find it!"
"e65b8308","...Oh, that's a shame. ""Time is money"", right?"
"e3095c7d","Please find the Platinum Poop Medal I lost somewhere!"
"e00957a4","I don't know where I lost it, but please find it somehow!"
"99401750","Oh, wonderful! You really found my Platinum Poop Medal?!"
"9c401c29","You handed over the Platinum Poop Medal!"
"9b401ab6","You've done so much to bring it back to me...I swear I won't
lose it this time!"
"9e401f0f","*gulp!* ...I won't lose it if I eat it, that's for sure!
What a great idea. Uh...hold on..."
"9d401d9c","I'm getting some crazy déjà vu here... OHHHHHHH!!
So THAT'S what happened! I swallowed the medal last time..."
"a0402255","...and flushed it down the toilet the next time I went!"
"9f4020e2","...Jeez, I'm so sorry... This is all my fault... As a way of
apologizing...I'll go to the city..."
"a24025bb","PlatinumNumemon joined the city!"

collect donations..."

donating such a large sum to me."
"4f22db3f","As thanks for saving me, I'll return the favor! I'll go to
help out in the city."
"4e22d94c","Huh? ""What about my 10,000 <icon>BIT</icon>, you say...?

"c737ef68","Listen up, human. You're the reason we came here..."
"da35ce9a","We wanna make you one of us! It's like what you've been
doing, but backwards, y'know?"

Or is it evil that would dominate?"

I can't right now..."

"87fafdb8","Uh, are you alright?
(Pretend you didn't see anything...)"
"88faff2b","Brrrr... This pelt is just too worn-out... Cold wind just
pours in through the holes!"
"8dfb06ca","Garurumon gave it to me, so maybe he'd be willing to fix it.
You have any idea where he could be?"
"8efb08bd","(You talked about Garurumon.)"
"8bfb03e4","Oh... Garurumon's in the city? I'm actually a bit shy...so
I'm afraid to just ask. Still, better make the first move."
"8cfb0557","Gabumon joined the city!"
"81faf426","Oh...um, you okay...?"
"82faf599","Ahh...Ahhh...AHHHHHCHOOO!!! Ugh, it's absolutely freezing..."
"2e9ae4f4","Why hello there! ...You came from Floatia? In that case,
I've got something you might be able to help me with..."
"319ae94d","What's up?
Sorry, maybe next time."
"309ae7da","Swell, thanks a bunch!"
"2b9ae03b","I possess medical knowledge, you see, and the other day I
came across an injured Digimon..."
"2a9ade48","I was going to treat it, but it started going nuts and ran
off somewhere..."
"2d9ae301","If you see that Digimon, could you please check on the state
of its wounds?"
"2c9ae1ae","The Digimon in question is Hackmon, around Logic Volcano.
Thank you for your cooperation!"
"279ad98f","I see... I sure am worried..."
"a4b77eef","The wounded Hackmon is at Logic Volcano..."
"a5b78042","But be warned, if it goes on another rampage like before,
it won't listen to a word you say."
"fe2dcd22","Oh! It looks like you got to meet Hackmon! ...What?! You two
fought, and now it's heading to the city?!"
"fd2dcb4f","Is that right...? I guess it's feeling better now. But
still, I hope it doesn't have any new injuries!"
"fc2dc9dc","Right, I'll head to the city, too. There's lots of Digimon
there, so my medical training will surely be useful!"
"fb2dc869","Angemon joined the city!"
"655ef679","Lucemon joined the city!"
"70b36853","Finally we meet, {0}! I'm Lucemon!"
"71b369c6","I've been watching you ever since you arrived in this world!"
"72b36bb9","You humans are so interesting! Good and evil, black and
white, you guys sure like to put things in their place!"
"73b36d2c","Well, what do you think when you look at me?"
"74b36e9f","Does this appearance look virtuous? How exactly can you tell
stuff like that?!"
"75b37072","Now then...how about THIS appearance?!"
"9d028638","If I were to put it in human terms...my existence has
transcended concepts of good and evil!"
"a0028af1","I wonder how you'd try to define me?! Would you just use
black or white? Or...would you use ""good"" and ""evil""?!"
"9f02891e","What about yourself, human? Are you good? Are you evil?"
"a2028dd7","Pfft...HAHAHAHA! Come, fight me! And teach me how you humans
can tell the difference about all this stuff!!"
"46cc6225","HAHAHAHA! Have my words left you perplexed? I sensed some
hesitation in your battle."
"43cc5d6c","But I think you should know the answer..."
"44cc5edf","That strength of yours...lets me think of you as a force of
good!"
"41cc5a06","It is what has let you stay so pure...so good, has it not?"
"42cc5bf9","...Nothing to say in reply? Ho ho, very well...then I shall
prove my faith to you..."
"3fcc5720","Next time we meet, I'll turn everything you believe in
upside-down!"
"36c83cf0","Lucemon SM joined the city!"
"64764396","There you are, {0}! I've been watching you
since last time we met..."
"63764223","Every time I saw what you do in this world, my thoughts
would change into convictions..."
"627640b0","The thing that lets me think you as a force of good...its
foundation is undoubtedly that strength of yours!"
"69764bb5","That's the thing, yeah? No matter what reasons come your
way, you always arrive at a conclusion through battle..."
"687649c2","Your victorious strength is good, the defeated weak are
evil, as you've shown! Now I'll overrule that shallow proof!"
"6776486f","With this form embodying evil itself!"
"18f0fc75","If those with power to be victorious in battle are good..."
"15f0f7bc","Through victory, can I shed this mantle of sin and transform
into a good existence?"
"16f0f92f","Or instead...will I just add another sin to my tally?"
"13f0f456","Now then! Fight me, so I can find that answer for myself!"
"7bce4408","...Pff, ha ha ha! I see! So that's the answer, is it?!"
"7ece48c1","The thing that lets me think of you as a force of good...its
foundation was not the strength I first believed it to be!"
"7dce476e","Mixing a noble heart with wicked thoughts...moving forward,
clutching pain and anguish in your heart...that power!"
"80ce4c27","That in itself is your...no, humanity's power!
That's why you can think of yourself as good, isn't it?!"
"7fce4ab4","Jeez... You humans are just too interesting..."
"82ce4f0d","I'll keep watching you, as I always have...please show me
that power of yours again sometime..."
"459fe1b9","...Hey, hey you! I have a tasty proposition for you, got a
second?!"
"429fdce0","Ooo, do tell!
Nah, no thanks..."
"439fde53","I knew you'd say that! When I said a tasty proposition, I
meant a chef that makes delicious dishes, you see."
"489fe672","The food that chef makes is always out of this world! I was
a regular at that restaurant..."
"499fe7e5","But...I don't know what that chef was thinking...he closed
his shop suddenly and went off somewhere..."
"469fe32c","So I want you to go looking for the chef yourself...I want
more tasty food, yeah? I want you to go order more!"
"479fe49f","The chef is Seraphimon. There are rumors of him being
spotted in Server Desert...so go for it!"
"4c9fecbe","What?! You don't like tasty propositions?!"
"feff19da","There are rumors of Seraphimon being in Server Desert!"
"fdff1867","I want you to ask him to make tasty food for me one more
time! I'm begging ya!"
"28c82c47","Huh? Really?! Seraphimon is gonna start cooking again?!"
"29c82e3a","This is fantastic! If I go to the restaurant in the city,
I can eat delicious cuisine again!"
"2ac82fad","I've gotta do it! I'll head to the city! This is all thanks
to you!"
"23c824a8","Ikkakumon joined the city!"
"e7af1067","...Oh! Digimon and a human, together...ho ho, so you've
finally come my way."
"e7af1062","So, what do you want with me?"
"e8af11da","Where's Magnamon?
Nothing."
"e9af134d","Oh, you're looking for Magnamon, too? Yeah, I heard the same
thing from ExVeemon."
"e2af0848","I see... He's in a bad way, is he? You've actually come at a
good time."
"e3af0a3b","Magnamon...only appears in Server Desert on Fridays! That's
the last info I've gotten my hands on."
"e4af0bae","Jeez, he was supposed to be hard to find... Well, it looks
like my job here is done."
"e5af0d01","Now I can finally go to Floatia. Next I'll gather info on
your partner Digimon, heh heh."
"deaf021c","Veedramon joined the city!"
"dfaf038f","What?! You seriously don't want anything?"
"ecb156fd","Jeez... I figured it was an errand from ExVeemon...
Guess I'm just unlucky."
"11ea75ea","Hey! Are you that Tamer gathering residents for the city?"
"10ea7477","In that case, can you beat me if we follow some odd rules?"
"fea7284","The rules are simple! If you can beat me in 60 seconds..."
"eea7111","...I'll return to the city! So whaddaya think, interested?!"
"dea6fbe","Got it, let's fight!
Not right now, thanks."
"cea6dcb","Ooo, nice answer! Okay, bring it on!"
"bea6c58","...Jeez, I just wanted to fight a little. Man, forget about
it, then... I'll wait here until you change your mind!"
"4c206d89","You came to fight? All right, let me explain the rules one
more time!"
"49206930","If you can beat me in 60 seconds, I'll go live in the city!
So whaddaya think, interested?!"
"cc7254bc","...Too bad, time's up!"
"cf725975","With those skills, you couldn't beat me no matter HOW much
time I gave you!"
"ce725782","Well, feel free to come back and take me on any time!
I'll be waiting."
"d3a69ad3","Oooh noooo, I loooost!"
"d4a69c46","Anyone who can speedily beat someone as confident as me is
quite the tough customer!"
"d5a69e39","All right! I'll return to the city as promised! I look
forward to what happens there!"
"d6a69fac","GaoGamon joined the city!"
"9bf8a53b","Cherubimon joined the city!"
"381b5bb5","You there... I have judged you a hero of pure heart, and
find myself in need of your assistance..."
"351b56fc","What's wrong?
Sorry, can't right now."
"361b586f","I am Cherubimon...one of the beings known as Celestial
Digimon..."
"331b5396","Recently, I have felt a presence of tremendous evil oozing
from the Concealed Gorge ahead of here."
"341b5509","This presence grows by the day...and were it to break free,
mayhap it could cover this entire world..."
"311b50b0","And were a good Ultimate Digimon such as I to make contact with
this pure evil, I fear the corruption might infect me..."
"321b5223","That is why, pure-hearted hero...I need you to rout this
evil in my place!"
"3f1b66ba","At this rate, this world will become shrouded in evil..."
"afdfb3d6","The evil presence pouring out of the Concealed Gorge
ahead...it threatens to cover this entire world..."
"aedfb263","DO_NOT_TRANSLATE"
"8331aea3","The evil... It's disappeared..."
"8431b016","Thanks to you, the evil that threatened this world is gone."
"8531b189","Continue to watch over this world with your pure heart!"
"8631b37c","Cherubimon joined the city!"
"fd3809f8","Zzzzzz..."
"380eb1","...Who dares disturb my slumber? You would bring calamity
upon yourself..."
"ff380cde","I am Belphemon, one of the Seven Deadly Digimon. As you can
see, I am trying to sleep... Won't you let me be?"
"2381197","What's this? You wish to borrow the power of a Demon Lord?
If so we must fight, so I may see your power..."
"1381024","Then let's fight!
(Maybe I should back off for now...)"
"43814fd","Very well, I shall finish this quickly and return to sleep!"
"338130a","How wise. Now you shall not have to face such a calamity."
"d0e8ec13","...Oh? You wish to borrow the power of a Demon Lord after
all? If so, show me your power in battle... Quickly, now."
"d1e8ed86","I shall finish this at once, so I may return to my slumber!"
"c4947846","Hmm, very well, I acknowledge your strength. I suppose this
is all I can muster in sleep mode..."
"c39476d3","The Demon World we Seven Deadly Digimon reigned over has
been lost, and so I moved to this land."
"c2947560","I don't care where I am, as long as I can rest. The city,
you say? ...Hmph, might as well go there."
"c9948065","Belphemon SM joined the city!"
"8a5d0d46","Oh, aren't you--? You are that human, uh... Now what was it
again...?"
"895d0bd3","Master Gankoomon...I believe this one is designated as
{0}..."
"885d0a60","Yes, that's right! All right then, how about a friendly
battle?!"
"8f5d1565","Master Gankoomon...should we not first check and make sure
they have made the necessary preparations?"
"8e5d13f2","Let's get right to it!
I need a bit more time."
"8d5d121f","You're raring to go, as they say! Well then, we'll come at
full force!"
"8c5d10ac","We want to see what you've got when you're in tip-top shape.
Come on back when you're ready to go."
"6cca7ae5","Hey! You're back!"
"69ca762c","Let us begin. You need not hold back against Royal Knights
like us!"
"c3009ef8","Well done, well done indeed! You pass with flying colors!
Jesmon, you agree, don't you?!"
"c600a3b1","Yes, with this we can lend you our power without concern."
"c500a1de","Glad you think so, too. Now then, we'll go to the city.
I look forward to when we meet again!"
"c800a697","Gankoomon and Jesmon joined the city!"
"99ef3764","Hmph... I imagine you're itching to go on ahead, but if you
want to pass, you'll have to defeat the Digimon before you."
"9cef3c3d","I bet you're thinking, ""it's just one opponent, what's the
big deal?"" ...Surprised? I can read your mind, buddy…"
"9bef3a4a","Oh ho, now you're thinking, ""Is this some kinda trap? Still,
I gotta keep going!"""
"96ef32ab","Heh heh... You wanna push on, despite worrying about the
potential traps... How reckless! Or should I call you brave?"
"95ef3138","We're coming through!
Let's wait and see for now..."
"98ef35f1","Fine, I'll see if that attitude of yours is bravery or just
plain foolishness! Come, my shadows!"
"97ef341e","...Heh, holding off, are ya? Thanks for making my job
easier!"
"2290bdf","Back again, are ya? Heh heh... You really are gonna try
braving the potential traps ahead..."
"3290db2","You think that makes you brave instead of careless?!"
"fccddd52","Ugh... What the--?!"
"fbcddbff","I don't get you humans at all. You act all reckless, but
it's...it's also like you're hiding something. But what?"
"facdda0c","Say what? I can find the answer in the city, you say? Heh,
don't get it twisted! I'm no ally of yours! "
"f9cdd899","Devimon joined the city!"
"ae99deba","Well well, what do we have here? Human child...did you come
all the way here to see me?"
"ad99dcc7","Now now, hold on. I don't feel like fighting you... Won't
you listen to what I have to say?"
"ac99db54","Will you come to the city if I listen?
Not interested..."
"ea673619","My, but you do work quickly, don't you?"
"e7673140","The boy Shoma once asked me the same thing, you know."
"e8673333","...?!"
"ed673ad2","Still, he wasn't QUITE my type, you know? I play a little
hard-to-get, and he leaves without a word!"
"ee673c45","I hate being tied down, you know? I do what I want, the way
I want..."
"eb67378c","Hmm, let's see... Right now I feel like getting out of here
and doing something fun."
"ec67397f","That city of yours sounds like it could be fun enough to
entertain me..."
"f167411e","Still, I won't do anything I find tedious or boring."
"f26742f1","Well, if you let me run my own shop, I guess I could give it
a shot..."
"ef697caf","Is it a promise, child?"
"ee697b3c","I promise!
Umm... That's...not gonna happen..."
"f1697ff5","My my..."
"f0697e02","Ho ho! That's the nervous face I wanted to see."
"eb697663","Don't worry, I don't really care about running my own place."
"ea6974f0","I just wanted to see how interesting your city is by looking
at your reaction."
"ed697949","Of course, if there are some nice shops I might just up end
taking over, you know?"
"ec6977d6","Be sure to stop on by, hee hee..."
"f7698907","LadyDevimon joined the city!"
"de12c24c","Is that right? You're not as hospitable as I thought..."
"e112c705","You're just like all the others! I was wrong about you."
"7eadccf7","Oooh, hey, you there! Excuse me, a little help?"
"7fadce6a","?"
"80adcfdd","I'm Paildramon. I wandered into this Infinite Cauldron
somehow."
"79adc4d8","Like me, others have wandered into this place. I don't know
why, but this can happen under unique conditions."
"7aadc64b","I have a special power that can be useful to you... Perhaps
I was sent here intentionally because of that."
"7badc83e","So anyway, I have an idea about how to get out of here,
but I can't do it by myself. I need your help!"
"7cadc991","Sure!
I have to keep going..."
"75adbeac","Thanks, you're a big help. I need you to bring me an item
that can repair this carapace armor of mine."
"76adc01f","Once it's fixed, I can escape from here... First, try to
find others who can help us here in the Infinite Cauldron."
"83b0130d","Urk...I'm sure I'd be of assistance to you, but...if you're
in a hurry then I'll let it go."
"bd05ebdc","Others are lost here in the Infinite Cauldron... One of them
must have an item that can fix my armor..."
"c005f095","Someone with armor of their own is likely to have it.
Good luck!"
"1cfe4129","Oh! You found the thing I need to fix my carapace armor?"
"19fe3c50","You handed over the DigiPate!"
"1afe3dc3","Okuwamon had this...? Hmph, well let's try it out..."
"1ffe45e2","Oh this is good...real good! This will fix me in a jiffy!"
"20fe4755","That's Okuwamon for you. To think he's gotten lost in here,
too.."
"1dfe429c","Hmm, so he's going to the city, too? Oh right, I have to
thank you somehow."
"1efe440f","Okay, repairs complete! I'll definitely do something to
return the favor. You'll see!"
"23fe4c2e","Paildramon joined the city!"
"36dd24cc","ARE YOUUU A HUUUMAN...?!"
"39dd2985","HMM...I HAVE NOT SEEN YOUUU BEFORE...WHY ARE YOUUU HERE?"
"38dd2812","Let me explain.
I can't tell you."
"33dd2073","I WAS BEATEN BY A DIFFERENT HUUUMAN FROM YOUUU, 
AND WOUUUND UP HERE."
"32dd1e80","MAYBE THAT HUUUMAN IS FURTHER AHEAD IN THIS AREA. YOUUU
WOULD GO TO DEFEAT THEM, WOULDN'T YOUU."
"35dd2359","IN THAT CASE...YOUUU AND I HAVE THE SAME GOAL. BUT DON'T
THINK I CAN TRUST WHAT YOUUU SAY JUST LIKE THAT..."
"34dd21e6","IF WHAT YOUUU SAY IS TRUE...THEN I MUUUST TEST YOUUU FIRST
IN BATTLE!"
"3fdd3317","HUUUMAN...YOUUU ARE INDEED UUUNTRUUUSTWORTHY."
"b12e1d27","HMPH, I UUUNDERSTAND. YOUUU DO NOT LIE."
"b22e1e9a","(You talked about Paildramon.)"
"b32e200d","HMM... PERHAPS HE CAN UUUSE THIS."
"ac2e1508","?"
"ad2e16fb","THIS IS CALLED ""DIGIPATE"". I UUUSE IT WHEN I AM WOUUUNDED."
"ae2e186e","LOOK, THIS INJUUURY I HAD IS ALREADY HEALED."
"af2e19c1","IT SHOUUULD WORK THE SAME FOR PALIDROMON'S CARAPACE ARMOR."
"a82e0edc","You got DigiPate!"
"a92e104f","I STAYED HERE TO FIGHT THAT OTHER HUUUMAN ONCE AGAIN, BUT..."
"b63063bd","I FEEL SO REFRESHED AFTER FIGHTING YOUUU! MAYBE I'LL GO AND
CHECK OUUUT FLOATIA."
"b53061ca","Okuwamon joined the city!"
"764413a","ARE YOUUU A HUUUMAN...?!"
"6643f47","HMM...I HAVE NOT SEEN YOUUU BEFORE..WHY ARE YOUUU HERE?"
"5643dd4","Let me explain.
I can't tell you."
"4643c61","HMMM... I THINK I UUUNDERSTAND."
"3643a8e","BUT YOUUU CANNOT HOLD ANY MORE ITEMS, CAN YOUU?"
"264391b","I CANNOT DO AS YOU WISH. PLEASE COME AGAIN, WILL YOUUU...?"
"16437a8","HUUUMAN...YOUUU ARE INDEED UUUNTRUUUSTWORTHY."
"4fd6e549","Why hello there... You've come at a good time."
"4cd6e0f0","My name is Sakuyamon. I have awoken for the first time in
centuries, and fear I am confused..."
"4dd6e263","I want to go to a place called Floatia. Could you guide me
there?"
"52d6ea02","That is Taomon's Taoist charm, is it not? Use it, and
boom..."
"53d6ebf5","I cannot use it myself.
Sorry, I have something to do."
"50d6e73c","Oh my, is that so? Very well, I'll ask the 'mon himself..."
"51d6e8af","Hello, can you hear me? ...Hey, wai--tch, how rude, Taomon!"
"56d6f04e","...Huh? An explanation? Umm... All right, all right...
I suppose I must."
"57d6f221","Grrr, FINE then, I'll go myself."
"d4d9f55f","Huh, you think that guy has his doubts about me...?"
"15a0edaa","That Taomon is being a real pain. I can't understand him at
all."
"14a0ec37","C'mon, use that Taoist charm, just a little!"
"930de197","Heh heh, sorry! Taomon's doubting me for some reason..."
"940de30a","You guys have proven it to me: times may change, but narrow-
mindedness doesn't..."
"950de4fd","He and I are from the same school of thought, you know..."
"8e0dd9f8","Huh? I'm talking too much? Fine, fine. Well, I've finally
gotten permission, so I'll head to the city."
"8f0ddb6b","Sakuyamon joined the city!"
"84b0e116","WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT?"
"83b0dfa3","I have a letter from Stingmon!
Sorry, wrong guy--er, Digimon."
"82b0de30","You handed over Stingmon's Letter!"
"89b0e935","THIS IS FROM STINGMON...? LET'S SEE HERE... HMM, HMM..."
"88b0e742","UGH... THIS GUY... *sniff*..."
"87b0e5ef","HEY, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?! I'M NOT CRYING!
YOU'RE CRYING!"
"86b0e47c","I CAME TO INFINITE CAULDRON AND LOST TRACK OF TIME
EXPLORING..."
"8db0ef61","I FORGOT ABOUT THIS FRIEND THAT WORRIES ABOUT ME SO...
WHAT A BLUNDER ON MY PART."
"8cb0ed8e","I HAVE TO THANK STINGMON FOR WORRYING ABOUT ME...AND I
HAVEN'T SEEN SUNLIGHT IN A WHILE NOW... "
"7fae9a80","I'LL GO TO THE CITY WHERE STINGMON IS WAITING... I'LL LEAVE
THE EXPLORATION OF THIS AREA TO YOU. "
"80ae9c73","MegaKabuterimon joined the city!"
"81ae9de6","...THE WRONG DIGIMON?"
"82ae9f59","THEN WHY DID YOU CALL OUT TO ME? WHAT A WEIRDO..."
"90ee05d3","Urgh... Sorry, but...
Would you lend me your help?"
"91ee0746","Sure, what's wrong?
Sorry, can't right now."
"92ee0939","First, let me name myself... I am SaintGargomon..."
"93ee0aac","I chased a certain Digimon from the other-dimensional
Digital World..."
"94ee0c1f","That Digimon is RustTyranomon! I drove him off just before he
annihilated our world... He is destruction personified..."
"95ee0df2","After a fierce battle, we drove it to a dimensional rift...
But he broke through it, and came to this world!"
"96ee0f65","I chased after him, and just when I was about to finish him
off, I somehow found myself in this world..."
"97ee10d8","But...before my energy runs out...please...take him out...!"
"98ee124b","Left to his own devices, he may destroy this world, too!
I want you to destroy that Digimon before this happens!"
"95f04c69","Ugh.. At this rate...my...my energy..."
"bd3d23b8","Left to his own devices, RustTyranomon could also bring this
world to ruin!"
"c03d2871","If you want to defeat him, you have to do it now, while he's
wounded! Do whatever it takes to beat him!"
"6706ffa5","Oh! You defeated RustTyranomon?!"
"6406faec","Thank goodness, the threat against this world has passed...
How lucky that I met you first."
"6506fc5f","I must repay the favor... Oh yes, you're gathering comrades,
aren't you?!"
"6206f786","In that case, let me lend you my power. I'll try looking for
a way back to my own world."
"6306f979","SaintGargomon joined the city!"
"f3d69a48","Please, you there... I need your help..."
"f6d69f01","?!"
"f5d69dae","I am known as MagnaAngemon..."
"f8d6a267","I sensed a great number of malicious beings, and answering
the summons to purify evil, came to this world."
"f7d6a0f4","Faced with the wicked power drifting in the Infinite
Cauldron...my body was ruined by the interdimensional trip."
"fad6a54d","My energy has been exhausted, to the point where I don't
even have strength to escape from this Infinite Cauldron..."
"f9d6a3da","Thus, I must ask you...in order to refill my energy, would
you bring me a Large Double Disk?"
"ecd68f43","You got it!
Maybe later?"
"ebd68dd0","...You have my thanks! As things stand, my body is going to
disappear... Please, you must help me!!!"
"eed45432","I see...but...please, come back as soon as you can!
Before my power...is spent...!"
"dc0fa5a3","In order to get enough energy to escape the Infinite
Cauldron, I need you to bring me a Large Double Disk!"
"dd0fa716","As things stand, my body is going to disappear!
Please, you must help me!!!"
"8bdaad6","You brought me a Large Double Disk?!"
"7bda963","Here's a Large Double Disk for you!
I can't give you one yet..."
"6bda7f0","You handed over one Large Double Disk!"
"dbdb2f5","...Ohhh! I was almost out of time! Now, I shall use it at
once..."
"cbdb102","*whew* You just barely saved me... Now I can escape from
this Infinite Cauldron..."
"bbdafaf","Still... I lack the power to purify this world... Could I,
perhaps, leave that task to you?"
"abdae3c","In exchange...I will stay in this world and help you any way
I can..."
"11bdb921","Yes...I understand now! This must be the true reason
I was summoned to this world!"
"10bdb74e","MagnaAngemon joined the city!"
"3bb6440","I see...but I will ask you next time... At this rate, my
power will soon expire!"
"4ef98345","Oh, human child... Somehow I have appeared in this world..."
"4bf97e8c","I am Phoenixmon. I erase the evil of the world with holy
power, and protect this proper, beautiful Digital World."
"4cf9807f","From what I can tell...the appearance of you humans upset
the balance of this world."
"49f97ba6","In other words...as long as you humans are in this world,
we will not be able to rid this world of evil..."
"4af97d19","Not all humans are evil!
Maybe you're right..."
"47f97840","In other words, you consider yourself to be good?
Then let us fight, and prove this to me!"
"48f97a33","If you think so, then leave this world at once!"
"3044f1a6","Oh child...you yet remain in this world? How many times must
I say this to you?"
"2f44f033","As long as you humans are in this world, we will not be
able to rid this world of evil!"
"aff30af3","Oh child...you certainly appear to be a force of good. The
true nature of man may be good, just as I am."
"b0f30c66","But...in time, that good may be steeped in vice. Still, you
are free from such corruption."
"b1f30dd9","As long as you continue to be a force of good, there may be
a single ray of hope that eliminates evil from this world."
"b2f30f4c","I am one that loves goodness and beauty... I maintain a
beautiful soul. Oh human child, I will keep watch over you."
"b3f3113f","Phoenixmon joined the city!"
"1baabbe2","Are you a Tamer? Ho...you've got some nerve, calling out
to me..."
"1aaaba0f","I am VenomMyotismon. As I am now, I tremble with the urge to
slaughter and destroy..."
"19aab89c","The only thing that can quench this thirst-like urge is
maddeningly violent battle!"
"18aab729","Well?! Will you fight with me, and satisfy my lust for
violence?!"
"17aab5b6","Okay...but I won't lose!
(Let's get out of here...)"
"16aab3c3","That is the right answer, Tamer! Satisfy me with the
seething blood of battle!"
"15aab250","Ho...so you would turn your back on me in fear...?"
"75e0e621","So you've returned, Tamer... You will fight me this time,
won't you?!"
"72e0e168","Fight me, and satisfy my overwhelming thirst for destruction
and death!"
"4c17d3b4","...Ho. That was the fierce combat I wanted!"
"4f17d80d","Still...the stronger you are, the stronger my urge becomes.
If this power erupts, even I will return to nothing..."
"4e17d69a","I don't want that... I've already got my eye on a place
where I can suppress this power. I'll head there now!"
"4917cefb","VenomMyotismon joined the city!"
"1c15bbf","Hmmm, Digimon from this world, and...a human...yes?"
"2c15d12","Turn back, if you don't want to die."
"3c15e85","You'll die eventually either way, so I guess it doesn't
really matter."
"fcc15380","Bzz...zzz...zzzt... This noise in my electronic brain...
Damn that SaintGargomon..."
"fdc15573","I'll defeat you, RustTyranomon!
(Let's get out of here for now...)"
"fec156e6","Bzzt...fine, I'll fi...bzzt...finish this in...bzz...ten
seconds...bzz...!"
"ffc15859","Hmph...fine... I'll finish you off later..."
"8ce1f5c4","You...death awaits you regardle--URGH... This noise...
what the...?"
"8fe1fa9d","Is it because my electronic brain is incomplete...? Curses!"
"155eae71","Rebooting... Rebooting... Reboot complete."
"125ea9b8","Where am I? What...who are you...? My memory banks...have
been wiped?"
"135eab2b","Tch...my rampage factor...has been auto-deleted... that was
the source of my directive to rampage until the world's end?"
"185eb2ca","Who put that there...and why? I don't know... Ugh... That
is...dimensional interference...? Should I head towards it?"
"195eb4bd","RustTyranomon joined the city!"
"f895dccf","A human... Wait, there are two Digimon with you...a Tamer?!"
"f995dea2","What a rare meeting! By all means, I'd like to request a
match with you..."
"fa95e015","Oh, I still haven't said my name... It's Agunimon! I've been
traveling to Digital Worlds looking for strong opponents!"
"f395d510","I've just come to this world, so what do you say? Please
fight me!"
"f495d683","I'll do it!
Sorry, can't right now..."
"f595d876","Thank you so much! Show me the power of your two partner
Digimon!"
"f695d9e9","That is a true shame... I'll go look for another opponent..."
"905c0854","Yo! Come to accept my challenge, have you?"
"935c0d2d","I waited here hoping you'd come back! So, are you willing to
fight now?!"
"ad7f89c1","I see... How exceptional! I mean, your partners are strong,
but that's not all..."
"aa7f8508","The most amazing thing is the unity between Digimon and
Tamer! It's like your partners can read your mind!"
"ab7f86fb","People like you are what make this world all the more
interesting... I think I'll stick around for a while!"
"b07f8e9a","Agunimon joined the city!"
"11a4db44","I am a member of the Holy Knight order known as the Royal
Knights. Call me Dynasmon!"
"14a4e01d","{0}, the Tamer who saved this world!
What is the real reason those two Digimon follow you?"
"13a4deaa","Loyalty derived from majesty? Or perhaps control by force?"
"ea4d68b","Would you fight me, and let me determine this for myself?"
"da4d518","If that's what you want, then let's fight!
I can't right now..."
"10a4d9d1","You've done me a great service in accepting my request!
I shall ascertain the true will of your partners!"
"fa4d87e","Too bad... Still, I shall remain here as long as it takes!"
"8684413f","Oh {0}, the Tamer commanding two Digimon..."
"87844292","Would you fight me, and let me determine the true meaning
behind these two Digimon following you?"
"3feb69b2","The reason those two Digimon follow you is neither loyalty,
nor forced dominion, it would seem..."
"3eeb67df","Nor is it the devotion I pledged to King Drasil. ...I see.
This is what they call a Bond!"
"3deb666c","What a fascinating relationship! I will continue to watch
over this Bond of yours!"
"3ceb64f9","Dynasmon joined the city!"
"5951f56b","You...the Tamer that saved this world! I see...you have the
same eyes as the Tamer who once guided me..."
"5a51f6de","Oh yes, my name...I'm Imperialdramon!"
"5b51f8b1","I once saved an other-dimensional Digital World from crisis,
using a bond with a Tamer much like yourself..."
"5c51fa24","When I came to this world, I heard rumors about you, and
grew interested in seeing your power with my own eyes..."
"5d51fb97","How about it? Do you think I could ask you for a fight?"
"5e51fd0a","If that's what you want!
Can we do it next time...?"
"5f51fefd","I'm grateful to you! Now then, neither of us should hold
back! Let's give it all we've got!"
"5051e700","That's too bad, but don't worry about it... I can be a bit
selfish. I await the next opportunity..."
"8b5d1bf0","You came back...savior of this world! You really do share
the same eyes as the Tamer who once guided me..."
"8e5d2049","Allow me to introduce myself once more... Please call me
Imperialdramon!"
"a8cb0b9d","I see... So that is the power that saved this world! Not
only that, but you came at me at full force, as I asked..."
"a5cb06c4","It would be rude of me not to meet that sincerity with my
own full strength!"
"a6cb08b7","Now then! Next I will unleash my full power, and change from
this dragon form...into Fighter Mode!"
"92ad7582","I didn't expect you to have this much strength... You have
far exceeded my imagination!"
"91ad742f","Damn... You are quite the fascinating Tamer... In this case,
I must request one final battle..."
"90ad72bc","This is my final form, one said to the founder of the Royal
Knights... Please fight with my Paladin Mode!"
"65940f4f","I thank you from the bottom of my heart for going so far to
accept my requests!"
"66941122","You are indeed a true Tamer, one of bravery and justice. You
also show unlimited trust and affection to your partners!"
"67941295","Thanks to you, for the first time in ages I was able to
recall my wonderful time together with my former Tamer."
"60940790","I cannot be happier to have met a Tamer like you! I hope we
meet again, and have another chance to fight!"
"61940903","Imperialdramon joined the city!"
"c02ac44a","...Who're you?"
"bf2ac2d7","You came here to play with me?"
"be2ac164","Give back ToyAgumon's block!
I don't have time to play."
"bd2abff1","Nope, nothin' doin'."
"bc2abe1e","This's a present from my friend."
"bb2abcab","This's my treasure."
"ba2abb38","So no, nothin' doin'."
"b92ab945","(You talked about how ToyAgumon can't move.)"
"b82ab7d2","Huh? Whaddaya mean?"
"bb287e34","This block came poppin' out when me and ToyAgumon were
playing, so I took it."
"bc287fa7","S true, he hasn't come play fer a while, but..."
"bd28811a","I had no idea that'd happened. Sorry..."
"be28828d","Yeah, 'm sorry. Just 'cause my face don't change, don't mean
I ain't sorry."
"b7287788","You got the ToyAgu Block!"
"b828797b","Hey, you, let's be friends. I'm goin' to the city. See ya."
"b9287aee","Monzaemon joined the city!"
"ba287c41","If ya can't, ya can't."
"7a6185e9","?"
"77618110","Who're you? Come ta play?"
"78618283","Give back ToyAgumon's block!
I don't have time to play."
"7d618aa2","Oh, that's kinda outta da blue. No way."
"7e618c15","Maybe sumfin else...huhhh? You ain't got no space for
items, do ya?"
"7b61875c","I won't play if yer items are full like that."
"7c6188cf","If ya can't, ya can't."
"6469c242","You cannot hold any more items."
"9663b666","Who the heck're you, hmph?! This is my sacred poop pile!"
"9563b4f3","This is the king's realm, where only those who pay tribute
may enter, hmph!"
"9463b300","I won't hear any explanations! Go on, get outta here! Hmph!"
"852a87b3","Warnings about the Field"
"852a87b2","From here on out, Digimon will appear that attack you as
enemies."
"852a87b1","Enemy Digimon react when you approach them. They will chase
you, and touching one will start a battle."
"852a87b0","A Digimon that doesn't react may be one that'll come to the
city. Talk to them with <icon>○</icon>, or get close to trigger an event."
"852a87b7","There's a Digimon nearby! Now, is it friend, or foe...?"
"852a87b6","City Prosperity and DigiMail"
"852a87b5","The wild Digimon decided to join the city! Now let's find
some partner Digimon and bring them back."
"852a87b4","Also, the DigiMail mark appeared in the lower right corner.
A notice will display whenever a DigiMail is delivered."
"852a87bb","Open your Digivice with <icon>△</icon> and try reading your DigiMail."
"842a85c1","Find Ingredients and Materials!"
"a028735f","The explanation was interrupted, so it will restart.
(Moving to the point where the interruption occurred.)"
"842a85c2","There are points in the field where ingredients drop and
materials can be found."
"842a85c3","This area has an ingredient (Digishroom) and a material
(Metal). Now, try getting some ingredients and materials!"
"842a85c4","Touch Ingredient or Material circles to display a
confirmation window. You can press <icon>○</icon> to take the item."
"842a85c5","Mushrooms, fruit, and other ingredients will drop in the
field."
"842a85c6","Gather as many as you can to stave off your partner
Digimon's hunger."
"842a85c7","Materials aren't too useful at first, but they'll be needed
to develop the city later on."
"842a85c8","The amount you can have changes depending on the Stamina of
your partner Digimon."
"842a85c9","When you return to the city, they are automatically placed
into city storage."
"872a8a98","World Connections"
"872a8a9b","This world is vast, and contains a multitude of areas,
each of which is split into several smaller areas."
"872a8a9a","The farther you go, the stronger your enemies become.
You must build up the strength of your partners."
"872a8a9d","For now, let's go to Nigh Plains and get used to living with
your partner Digimon."
"862a8927","Digimon Battles (Continued)"
"862a8924","Now then, there's a hostile Digimon right over there!"
"862a8925","You won't be able to cross the bridge unless you defeat
it first!"
"862a8922","I'll take this opportunity to explain more about battle
controls and strategy."
"862a8923","I've filled up your partner's HP and MP. Let's use this
battle to learn how things work!"
"862a8920","OP (Order Power) at Battle Start"
"862a8921","OP gained in battle will not carry over to the next battle.
It will reset to the base value every time."
"862a892e","The base value of partner OP at the start of battle
increases the higher your Bond is with your partners."
"862a892f","What's more, if you battle a lot in a short time, you will
gain five bonus OP for each partner."
"892a8dff","The more OP you have at the start, the more decisively you
can fight. Use this to your advantage!"
"a3da2db8","Oh...you came, {0}! I've been waiting for you."
"a3da2db9","This place may look like Infinite Cauldron, but it seems
we're in a different dimension."
"a3da2dba","There are limits to how long you can be here...plus you
can't make any records."
"a3da2dbb","It seems like a pretty nasty place...
We'll have to be careful."
"a3da2dbc","The one we're after is farther inside... I don't know what
kind of enemies we'll face on the way, though."
"a3da2dbd","Each area isn't that big. Let's split up so we don't get in
each other's way."
"a3da2dbe","All right, see you up ahead!"
"a3da2dbf","Warning!
You cannot save your game here."
"65fca7d2","I'M BORED... PLAY WITH ME?"
"65fca7d3","THAT WAS FUN!"
"ccad6de3","YOU CAME... LET'S HAVE FUN!"
"ccad6de2","YOU ARE STRONG! I AM SATISFIED."
"d3ad78e1","You cleared Dimension M! Returning to the city."
"aec12b8f","MORE... GIVE ME MORE BATTLE ENERGY!!!"
"aec12b8e","MUHAHAHA, HOW BRILLIANT!"
"c85f4e1e","I don't know what to do with such power right after waking
up. Perhaps you could battle with me?"
"c85f4e1f","Great, {0}! I expected no less from you, human."
"c15f4310","You cleared Dimension G! Returning to the city."
"3b876890","You've come, have you? I remember...someone rewrote my
battle brain..."
"3b876892","I was transformed into a machine that would not stop
destroying until this world was no more..."
"3b876893","Thanks to you, I was released from that state! Allow me to
fight you as my way of saying thanks!"
"3b876891","Come take on this overwhelming battle power anytime!"
"c0fb2c41","...!!!
(^ ^)"
"c0fb2c40","...!!!
m(_ _)m"
"b7fb1e7f","You cleared Dimension T! Returning to the city."
"f0e5e165","Ho... I desire combat."
"f0e5e164","That was a good fight..."
"a3451d4","Rather, I was soundly defeated. Allow me to get straight to
the point."
"a3451d5","Muwahaha! That made my blood boil! How satisfying."
"33446e6","You cleared Dimension P! Returning to the city."
"966bdbbe","You enjoying yourself, {0}?
Let me have some fun, too!"
"966bdbbf","You've gotten better again. I'd better get serious myself!"
"fcccefaf","Now come, turn this battle into strength!"
"fcccefae","What a great battle. Like justice transformed into power
itself!"
"3ccfa9d","You cleared Dimension E! Returning to the city."
"2533dafb","You've come, child... You'll help me with my research, won't
you?"
"2533dafa","Mwahaha, very well! This magical metamorphosis... What
exceptional results...!"
"f87ecfca","Yo, {0}, I'm happy you came all this way!"
"f87ecfcb","This space is really strange... In this form, my power is
unlimited."
"f17ec4cc","You cleared Dimension Z! Returning to the city."
"2b6de9c4","You've come all this way, have you? Allow me to help you.
Nnnn...SHAAA!"
"2b6de9c5","60 seconds restored!"
"2b6de9c6","All right, now go. Don't go wasting that precious time."
"d871dd15","Ha ha ha, you've done well to get here. Now, accept my
fighting spirit!"
"d871dd14","Partner <icon>機嫌</icon> maxed out!"
"d871dd17","Heh, now rout the enemy with that spirit!"
"ec9ec0e2","I shall bestow my power upon you. Take it!"
"ec9ec0e3","Partner STR and WIS raised by 50!"
"ec9ec0e0","You cannot overestimate yourself simply because your ability
has increased."
"26490eb3","I shall give you some time... However...you don't think that
comes for free, do you?"
"26490eb2","120 seconds restored!
10,000 <icon>BIT</icon> stolen!"
"26490eb1","Ha ha ha, I told you it wasn't free!"
"26490eb0","120 seconds restored!
All of your <icon>BIT</icon> were stolen!"
"3a75f200","You've come at a good time. I want you to take these..."
"3a75f201","You got several items!"
"3a75f202","Bringing only what you need in your inventory will prevent
wasting your items."
"63ce371","You've done well to make it here! I'll give you this power!"
"63ce370","Partner HP and MP raised by 200, and STR, STA, WIS and SPD
raised by 20!"
"63ce373","My power is for the future... You must be steadfast in all
things."
"34062dfe","You're quite the lucky one. I'll impart a fraction of my
wealth to you here and now."
"34062dff","You got 30,000 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"34062dfc","Now go, any more and I'll consider you quite greedy."
"9a6741ef","Hee hee, you've got a good look in your eyes, as usual. Let
me help you out a little."
"9a6741ee","Partner Bond, DigiFriend and <icon>機嫌</icon> raised by 20!"
"9a6741ed","Hmm, that wasn't too helpful, you say? My bad!"
"81dd5f1c","Oh, we meet again. Let me do something to help you out."
"81dd5f1d","You got DigiHolywater, DigiDiamond, Blue Digizoit and
DigiGodwood x 3!"
"81dd5f1e","Oh, this isn't what you were expecting? Well, doing the same
thing as everyone else won't help, will it?"
"83ea5ad","You've made it this far, so you can take a break. Here, let
me lend you some strength."
"83ea5ac","Partner MP raised by 500, and SPD raised by 50!"
"83ea5af","This dimension is really weird... It gives me access to a
region of power I normally cannot manifest."
"df9c19a7","In this space, I can even perform feats such as this...
Heh, go on. Take it."
"df9c19a6","Partner Life raised slightly!"
"df9c19a5","Whew, did it work?"
"a07b8336","I'd say it's time to show my power! This golden armor ain't
just for show, y'know!"
"a07b8337","You got 1,000 <icon>LUCK</icon>!"
"a07b8334","Gold brings good luck, y'know!"
"72b23849","I don't really understand it, but...my Royal Knight power...
it's...WOOOOOOH!"
"72b23848","A random amount of time was restored!"
"72b2384b","This power has yet to stabilize... I have to consult the
others on how to control it."
"c5fdf718","Hmm... You have quite a bit of time remaining, in a way.
In that case, how about this?"
"c5fdf719","60 seconds lost!
Partner Life raised slightly!"
"c5fdf71a","Heh heh... Better hurry up... Sometimes if you chase two
rabbits you can catch both, if you're good enough."
"b18161ab","I acknowledge your effort! Here, for further endeavors!"
"b18161aa","Partner HP raised by 500, and STA raised by 50!"
"b18161a9","Continue to persevere. This will become the power that
carves out the path of your destiny."
"f825fc7a","Ho ho ho... Let me increase your time. But in exchange..."
"f825fc7b","120 seconds restored!
Partner HP and MP stolen!"
"f825fc78","Sorry if that was a bit sudden. Still, a small price to pay,
don't you think?"
"63aa300d","I'm training here so I can beat you next time.
You'd better make yourself stronger! Take this."
"63aa300c","Tamer experience increased by 2,000!"
"63aa300f","I haven't trained enough to beat you yet.
But I will defeat you one day!"
"63aa300e","Your Tamer level is maxed out.
Never mind. Take this instead."
"63aa3009","You got 1,000 <icon>LUCK</icon>!"
"92cbe46","It's a vending machine."
"92cbe47","A vending machine. Has ""Prizes inside!"" written on it."
"92cbe44","Oh! You won!!!"
"92cbe45","You got Phantom Nectar x 1!"
"122ccc98","You can't carry any more items, so the transaction was
cancelled."
