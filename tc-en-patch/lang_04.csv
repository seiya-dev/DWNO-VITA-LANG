"5","ea5c049c","That's right--Project Reincarnation.
Taomon's brainchild."
"12","7f591d94","Purge the world and let it be reborn?
Is that even possible?"
"13","80591f07","It wouldn't be easy, but with Omegamon Zwart D in our hands,
it would be theoretically possible."
"19","7a5915f5","At worst, two merging dissonant worlds could interfere with
one another so much as to lead both of them to ruin."
"25","7e56dd4a","I am, but how else are we supposed to save the world?
Scared or not, we've got no choice."
"38","6d548410","The other core of Project Reincarnation is the town of
Floatia. Keep populating it until the plan is ready to go."
"42","8165ec8d","We'll let you know when we hear from Mirei. {0},
you help gather residents too."
"44","2d253ea4","You OK? Nothing too painful happened?"
"47","2c253d31","Some fascinating things, indeed. The one that caught me by
surprise at first was... the makeup of Luche's body."
"48","29253878","It highly resembles that of a Digimon. They have a
similarity of--ready for this?--98.1%."
"55","96282246","Next, and this will be difficult for you too, Luche, but...
That stuffed animal you were holding?"
"57","982825ac","I've confirmed that most of what we've spoken about aloud
was transmitted over the network to... somewhere."
"59","9a2828f2","Luche... was a carrier for the BH Program."
"62","2320b198","Ahh. So we looked over Luche herself, but the stuffed
animal was the blind spot."
"66","2720b7c4","That's the problem. Luche is an asymptomatic carrier, so
considering that she lost her memories--"
"68","2920bb2a","Yes. Which makes the one using her--"
"71","1c20a693","I b-betrayed everyone... I got you sick!
Does that make me... bad?"
"73","2822f82e","That's right.
You couldn't have known, Luche."
"78","2b22fce7","Payback?"
"87","ac2f00ed","So I'm... useful?"
"95","2e320c2a","Looks like it. Might as well start now! C'mon, {0} and Kouta, let's go!"
"98","3679adb8","Thanks to all of your hard work, Floatia is now
capable of launching Project Reincarnation."
"99","3d79b8bd","The town is now effectively a massive computer processor.
If we insert Omegamon Zwart D here as the core..."
"100","3c79b6ca","His purification power, combined with the antivirus, should
bring about a total data purge."
"115","a57ed943","Wha-- The Singular Zone?! Impossible!"
"119","a97edf8f","We found a vast, essentially infinite blank space in the area
that was picking up Luche's signal."
"120","a87ede1c","In there, we observed multitudes of formless blocks of data,
plus the data of a number of Digimon... and one human."
"122","aa7ee162","An infinite space? Sounds like the perfect place to move
the data to."
"123","ad7ee63b","Exactly. No need to move it piece by piece--we could migrate
all the data there together, at once."
"139","ad836309","There might be some important data there that we'd need
to have reincarnated."
"141","ab836023","Taomon and Luche and I will go beneath the town and open the
gate to the Singular Zone."
"147","ad812492","And save all our worlds!"
"153","84982eb4","--ear me? Can you hear me, {0}?"
"159","ab613c68","You've bandaged up your broken heart with bravery--or is
it idiocy?--and now you stand before me again. Bravo."
"165","a56132d6","There's the problem. The battle you seek--it should be with
the ultimate opponent, the one central to the AR Plan."
"170","346452aa","As we should be."
"176","2a6442ec","{0}, leave this to--"
"178","a25cb0cf","This is really not the time... But whatever.
Fine, all together! One, two, three!"
"181","542b16e2","I've been waiting for you, {0}!
No need for words--you know what comes next!"
"184","ce75b7af","My... My strength was not enough...
That was... remarkable, {0}."
"185","cf75b902","There is... nothing stopping you anymore.
Go on, see the new world for yourself."
"187","c975aff0","You're... too late. You can no longer stop it...
No one can."
"188","ca75b163","I only regret... that I cannot witness... the birth of this
new world... with my own eyes... But I've still won."
"195","7df8c04","Hah, so you've made it too.
Although your partners seem badly wounded..."
"197","9df8f6a","Oh well, I'll just have to show you all my discovery. Beyond
altered form--Ultimate Altered Digivolution!"
"202","7cdc72fc","It was your partner who gave me the idea... Kouta Hirose."
"204","7adc6f96","You... Did you see Yukimura turn into SkullGreymon?"
"206","78dc6cb0","And then... I experimented with different methods of
breaking them, to see what they became."
"209","87dc842d","Heheheh. You've all led me to such interesting discoveries!"
"210","78da2dd9","And, thanks to all of them, the AR Plan--the Advanced Realm
Plan--will finally come to fruition here."
"212","76da2af3","Heh... Heheh! Oh, nothing, really.
I just want to see..."
"219","7fda38de","I can! That's the point of the BH Program--to make all
Digimon, and the Digital World itself, into altered forms!"
"223","75d7eaa9","Bwahahaha! Now... Omegamon Alter-B!"
"231","800f4545","That's... impossible!!!
No! There's no way! This--cannot be HAPPENING!"
"235","7c0f3f19","You! That brat from before?!
The stupid little brat who crushed my ambitions?!"
"238","870f504a","Ah... Vanishing! No... Not like this! Help... Help m--
Nuh-- uuuOOOOOOAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!"
"240","85118bdb","Could it be... Is he...?"
"242","87118f21","{0}! Use the antivirus program!
Just bring them back to Floatia!"
"247","8a1193fa","{0}, can you get the Enforcer?
I'll bring this one."
"252","eb6e1967","Huh? What are you doing calling him that?"
"257","ec7059b1","Aw geez, I've been impolite this whole time...
Buuuut he's not at my school, so I should be fine, right?"
"264","ed705b24","Taking it apart, putting it back together...
And making it anew?"
"268","f372a32d","I suppose if we tried, we could use it on every single thing
in this world."
"269","f0729e54","Then... Would you do this for me? Would you... disassemble me?
I don't need to be reassembled."
"272","ef729ce1","It's good you're remorseful, but... This is scary."
"283","5e758a15","Yeah. I... used to be a Digimon. I had a kind partner, and I
was the happiest Digimon ever!"
"288","5f77ca7f","So you met Tsuzuki in the Singular Zone?"
"290","6177cd45","But the Singular Zone's huge. To be called by a human who
accessed it by chance and actually meet them? Miraculous!"
"294","5d77c719","Just as you and your partners were,
and Kouta and Himari and their partners were..."
"301","607a0a49","Back in that tournament, I... lost to {0}."
"302","5f7a08d6","Tournament? You mean back in fifth grade? Didn't you win that time?"
"304","5d7a05f0","So I... I cheated. I modded my partner's data."
"310","e97d208b","Anything the network could tell me, I wanted to learn.
But in the process... I first heard of the Digital Dive."
"314","ed7d2737","The Singular Zone was... full of the unknown. Ruins of
Digimon I'd never seen, huge clouds of mysterious data..."
"317","f07f6a67","It's clear to me now how foolish I was, but... In the moment,
I was overjoyed, and I reached out to touch the light."
"318","ef7f68f4","From that moment, madness lived within me.
And the rest... Well, the rest you all know."
"320","f17f6bda","I remade Luche using the ruined data I found in the Singular
Zone... And I used her."
"323","ee7f6701","There was plenty of bad stuff, but I was happy I got to
meet you all!"
"325","e87f5d8f","Luche... But I..."
"331","da5a76ec","It's OK with you? Really?"
"336","df5a7e8b","All we can do is drift along. I don't like it, but
I suppose it's part of the flow of life."
"341","e05cbed5","So... Everything's finally settled?"
"343","de5cbb8f","It's a gamble whether things will work out with Omegamon
Alter-B, but... at least the Reincarnation's a success."
"347","464279f3","So... it's goodbye?"
"348","45427800","Once the Reincarnation Project is complete, you'll be able
summon everyone again, you know."
"350","47427b66","So... I'll see you again?"
"351","4a42803f","You bet! I'm definitely coming back here...
Once things calm down!"
"355","4e42866b","B-But..."
"358","6140659d","Sure! I can teach you... um...
how to make your friends laugh, or something!"
"360","5f4062b7","Yes. Please teach me that."
"361","5c405dfe","Wait, he's actually serious."
"367","da3d52a1","Um, why are you taking the compliments?
I'm pretty sure {0} here worked the hardest."
"368","d93d50ce","C'mon, let's not be so tough on each other."
"371","de3d58ed","Rikka, wait for me just a little while, OK?"
"374","db3d5414","Thanks for everything!
And hey--I can't wait to see you again!"
"377","3de169db","It's time to keep your promise. Come on, equip your Digivice!"
"378","34f5c504","Whatever else you do, you need to gather residents.
Can't get anything done without helping hands. Shake a leg!"
"379","e782c649","We'll let you know the moment there's a word from Mirei.
Please keep gathering residents."
"380","f1e84839","How many Digimon have we called by now?
It feels like it a lot, but I guess we're not done yet..."
"381","3e6ba5a9","The bigger our crew, the more we can build, and the easier
our adventures will become!"
"385","7a07f5","We still need more residents!
Keep going! Let's finish this!"
"386","a4b24b34","Our future feels secure now.
All we need to do is to gather more residents."
"389","4aec4bd8","How the hell could he do that to Luche?
Shoma Tsuzuki, you'll pay for this!"
"390","c9f26d3b","It's unforgivable!
Time to show him what real justice looks like!"
"391","8d950308","I'm different from {0}?
What a bummer..."
"394","2d180abe","This world hangs in the balance! Looks like it's up to you once
again!"
"397","4beecadb","Looks like we're splitting up. I've got Mr. Mameo here, so don't worry
about me!"
"398","872211ac","I'm feeling power overflowing from within my heart!
Leave Kouta to us!"
"399","8f25352c","We'll take care of Kouta! You just keep it together over
there!"
"400","f25aba67","This world hangs in the balance! Looks like it's up to you once
again!"
"401","a4fbba26","I still can't believe this, but the only way is
forward. I'm counting on you, {0}."
"404","e0f8dade","Looks like we're splitting up. I've got Mr. Mameo here, so don't worry
about me!"
"405","3deac55","I'm feeling power overflowing from within my heart!
Leave Kouta to us!"
"406","e01d110a","You come back, you hear, so I don't get lonely!
Please, {0}!"
"407","f69b3d","We'll take care of Kouta! You just keep it together over
there!"
"409","ce0f69d0","This world hangs in the balance! Looks like it's up to you once
again!"
"410","6aab870d","I see. The inside is block data topography..."
"413","bebe6c31","Looks like we're splitting up. I've got Mr. Mameo here, so don't worry
about me!"
"414","4d056d66","I'm feeling power overflowing from within my heart!
Leave Kouta to us!"
"415","d8f07aed","You come back, you hear, so I don't get lonely!
Please, {0}!"
"416","3b384e96","We'll take care of Kouta! You just keep it together over
there!"
"417","73efe23e","We've still got a good way to go.
I'm counting on you to go the distance!"
"418","ca9206a1","Samudramon and Kuzuhamon!
They're some tough opponents...prepare carefully!"
"420","96679e70","Leave everything here to us.
You go on and deal with what's up ahead!"
"424","94f39984","Himari and Kouta both got to go...
Ugh! I wanna be useful too!"
"425","d8203f77","Looks like the confidant has taken the stage.
Don't underestimate their strength! Be careful!"
"426","6fe2185a","All that's left is the last room. There's nothing left to
say, except that we're counting on you, {0}."
"428","7fef9bff","We beat them, barely, but...I can't do any more."
"429","f349a0f","I'm sorry... I've used up my powers."
"430","2dc1e9ef","Ungh! I can carry on...I can...
Nope, I can't move. Sorry, {0}."
"431","39d2b600","Even if I went along, I'd just slow you down.
I'm sorry, {0}, it's up to you."
"432","16aa35d7","Go! Charge into the last room!
Agh, I wanna charge in toooo!"
