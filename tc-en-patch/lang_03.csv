"18","f8905195","I see... But that might be very difficult."
"19","f7905022","It's pointless to cut the network cables if the ground
itself is infected."
"24","ea927a02","No... No, no, no! I won't let you say that!
Right, Taomon?"
"67","9ade8d9c","All Digimon... No, all of the Digital World is wrapped up in
that person's plans!"
"72","36e63203","Hey... {0}!
I won't forget this!"
"79","f058c94c","Oh dear, {0}...
You came back at the worst possible time."
"83","f458cff8","We're wondering if it was Mr. Mameo, who was in charge of
immunization, who let the infected Digimon in on purpose."
"90","f55b0fc2","Leave it to me!"
"92","f35b0cfc","Don't say that! I'll-- I'll go with you, Mr. Mameo!"
"97","795e1e65","I'm innocent. I want you to believe that."
"101","755e1839","Think on it... If the answer is Yes, come to Nigh Plains."
"106","71aab1d2","I'm saying that all that hubbub before was staged.
To flush out the real traitor."
"108","6faaae8c","Yes. I've had my doubts for some time now, but now that
we're here, I'm very sure of it."
"109","76aab9f1","There are big plans afoot now. There mustn't be even the
smallest shred of doubt."
"114","6ba869e9","Whoa... I don't know what to think... But, OK.
I believe you, Mr. Mameo."
"117","6ea86ea2","So how will we flush out the traitor?"
"121","fab0068b","Aha! You want them to go check it out so we can tail them
and pin them down over there!"
"124","fbb0087e","Since hardly anyone ever goes near Bony Resort, if anyone
falls into our trap... Well, we'll know then."
"126","fdb00b44","I'll sneak on over, staying out of sight.
You two should go on ahead to check it out first."
"127","b0101d","Got it! OK, {0}! Let's race to Bony Resort!"
"129","895f388c","Huh! Someone really is caught in the trap!"
"130","8a5f3a7f","Hey! You two! Why are you-- Hey?!
You're not the ones who set this trap, are ya?!"
"131","875f35a6","Which means... all that talk about a secret weapon was a lie?!"
"151","132f8291","What's going on... Omegamon Zwart D failed?
I didn't plan for this..."
"162","8a2c6c6f","Hey! Get up! Get up and do somethin' about them!"
"163","872c6796","That's right! That's the way to finish 'em!"
"166","862c6623","Has the antivirus program worked to restore your sanity?"
"170","842a2466","Is that what you meant by ""big plans"", Mr. Mameo?"
"172","822a2100","Oh... You're right. The traitor... It was Luche, right?"
"182","8227e2a9","Are you... Tsuzuki?"
"194","84392ed0","For now... Do with him as you will.
I will work on finishing the AR Plan."
"195","873933a9","Omegamon Zwart D will soon be utterly broken...
When that happens... Heheheh..."
"200","8436f079","To control all worlds... To create a new world..."
"202","8236ed13","A massive new world, rife with confusion, will be born...
Heheheh... Does it not make your heart sing?"
"204","8836f6a5","That's fine. I don't need you to understand."
"213","19340971","We almost lost Omegamon Zwart D, who is critical for the
coming AR Plan, to the enemy. An unforgivable crime."
"222","1a31cc0d","Luche, c'mere. We might be able to figure something out
if I can analyze your data."
"226","1631c5c1","It looks like they've come for us. Let's go back to the
city. Your partners need to rest."
