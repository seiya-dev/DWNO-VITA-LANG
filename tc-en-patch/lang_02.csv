"21","ef81a9c4","So who's responsible for this? Who'd write a program that
could hack into the world's self-purification function?"
"25","eb81a398","Huh. So, I guess... she helped us? I was positive we were
done for."
"26","ee81a851","Her name was Mirei, right? What do you think her deal is?
She seems to know a whole lot, but... Think can we trust her?"
"37","66d77bf9","Omegamon Zwart D... the Enforcer. To think that even
he's been infected..."
"50","73dc0d5e","True that! She was calling you by name.
She didn't recognize me or Kouta right away, though."
"51","74dc0f31","Why did the three of us get pulled into this world, anyway?
Maybe it DOES have to do with that tournament back then."
"54","77dc138a","Shoma... Tsuzuki? It couldn't be."
"80","c8599b4b","That's good to hear, but Himari and {0} got
here at the same time, and look how far ahead they are..."
"81","c8599b4a","That's good to hear, but it sure looks like I'm
the only one getting left behind."
"88","cf5be527","Well... Thanks, you two. But, and I'm sorry to ask... Could
you leave me alone for a while?"
"110","9da9c30a","We'll never be able to patch up these network outages if we
don't find out about the BH Program and move forward."
"113","90a9aef3","Yeah... Thanks. Not that our bodies can get tired in this
world, but..."
"129","4d3af2ca","No... Actually, Himari's nothing like me. She's so much
stronger than I am."
"136","4e3d3314","I'll go too!"
"146","b84018a9","And when it does... Well, you know what happens."
"161","90a08e66","My partner... Himari, she... I went after her, but she...
She said, ""Don't come near me,"" and then she ran off..."
"164","cc1cd76d","Himari!"
"173","311fb4c3","My partner...? My partner wouldn't... wouldn't be so..."
"176","321fb6b6","Ah! {0}, what do we do?!"
"177","351fbb0f","It looks like her form is altering, right? Is... Is it my
fault? For pushing her away?"
"179","f8c894fa","A-aaAAAaaaa... aaAA...m-my.. mY HEAd, ittttttttttttt'sszszzs"
"182","f5c89021","H-Hngh... Gyaaaaaah!!!"
"187","9e926abb","Himari... You have sisters?"
"194","a594b417","Himari, don't cry. I'm all right.
{0} saved me."
"195","a494b2a4","Right? You... used some program on me, didn't you?"
"202","d979646","Himari... Do I scare you?"
"208","f9799ac","Yes... I think so. My body feels... full of power."
"211","1697a491","Oh, it's Taomon's gate. Thank goodness! C'mon, Rikka,
let's get you back to town and patched up."
"213","1299dcdc","Thanks so much for everything, {0}. I'm so
grateful. I want to stay near you for the rest of my life!"
"216","e6f862f7","Come on! You won't get stronger than anybody
with an effort like that!"
"219","e1f85ad8","I know I'm not setting a great example, but I need to
ask you to put a stop to it."
"220","e2f85c4b","Don't try and stop us, {0}! This is Yukimura's and
my problem to solve!"
"229","d3fa8345","Guh-GAAAH... AAAAAAAaaaaahhhh..."
"239","d08a7def","Please make Yukimura calm down!"
"244","9d7f55d7","Sorry, just talking to myself. Anyway, we've got other
things to worry about."
"250","9d81944e","I'm the only one who's just... nothing. It was the same in
the real world, too."
"252","9b819168","I'm sure I was the kind of guy people would be jealous of.
And of course I appreciated that, but all the same..."
"253","a2819c6d","When I had to actually think about what I wanted to do in
life, I realized I was just... empty inside."
"255","a0819907","I had this vague picture of how I'd enjoy myself, find some
job or other, get married or something, get older..."
"256","9f819794","And just have a pretty average, decent life, but..."
"261","2284a444","I was sure of that after I met {0}. I knew right
away... that I was just an empty nobody after all."
"264","2184a2d1","It's true. That was pretty stupid of you."
"265","1e849e18","You've got a partner who believes in you and risks all kinds
of danger for you, no matter what."
"269","a86bd73","All this time, you never noticed that you had something no
one else has in your hands all along."
"275","1086c685","As cool as he talked, he still relied on you so
much, {0}."
"280","63a6770b","Long time no see."
"282","69a6809d","Thanks to all of you. I can't thank you enough."
"288","dfa368e8","Normally that simply means we must address some issues that
seem innocuous, but this has spiraled beyond my predictions."
"304","57aae1b5","Yes, that test data was quite useful. An unexpected benefit
of Kouta and Himari's... episodes, perhaps."
"306","59aae49b","You're... welcome?"
"338","68c6a4a1","Is this... a barrier? There was nothing in my sources about
safeguards like this..."
"345","a1c16343","It's a pretty... unique program, so changing any bit of it
makes the effects fade right away."
"348","acc174f4","Well, I thought, maybe... What about Datamon?"
"352","a8c3ad3f","So you don't know where Datamon is?"
"371","fc19dc09","Ow! What's going... My... My head!"
"375","819ef2d","Ah... AaaAAAahhHHH!!!"
"380","fd179f05","Feh. This wasn't part of my calculations. Time to beat it
before things get any worse!"
"381","58982c25","OK, I think this should be good."
"387","52982293","I see. Which means the goal was probably keeping you quiet
and under control... And it's not hard to guess why."
"395","b1ce54f1","Wait, wasn't Mr. Mameo with you?"
"398","b2ce5664","Um... Since when exactly?"
"409","a3cc0010","Soooo... Mameo's a bad guy?"
"410","a4cc0183","Look, now you went and led this innocent kid astray."
"412","b2cc178d","Probably, huh? Well, he's guilty until proven innocent!"
"413","a3c9c1b9","*chuckle* That's right."
"416","a0c9bce0","It is I who-am grateful. {0} kindly res-cued me
from a dangerous sit-u-a-tion."
"420","a4c9c32c","Nah. MetalEtemon is an excellent fighter, but not the kind
of Digimon you'd call... ""brainy."""
"431","25c6bca8","And if it isn't, we'll need to fix it... and at the same
time, to protect it."
"432","26c6be1b","Yup. The enemy could be at Server Tower by now. We've got
to be ready to forestall them."
"442","2ed813d4","{0}, just take care, won't you? The enemy has
Ultimates fighting for them. No letting your guard down."
"445","e69db9ce","Aaahh! Not your partner too...
We have to stop them, but..."
"448","eb9dc1ed","Mwahahaha! It's over! No... It's just begun! I, Titamon, have
lit the fire that will forge a new world!"
"456","db9b6a26","An entity such as you would never understand. I... I am the
executioner of gods!"
"457","dc9b6b99","Wait! Stop that! If the equipment breaks, we can't transmit
the antivirus program!"
"460","e79b7cca","Oh, that's right... You had the antivirus program, {0}."
"466","dd992e95","Wait, was that... movement? Did you actually manage to
optimize the antivirus program?!"
"470","8e6792d5","Ngh... You're strong, I admit it. But I won't allow anything
to get in the way of my allies' plans... or mine!"
"471","8b678e1c","Is Titamon seriously gonna self-destruct?!"
"474","8a678ca9","Gah! Ngh... But... The BH Program update... Bwahaheheh...
My task is complete!"
"478","96679f4d","Then we might be able to get away!"
"481","9569dcb1","Phew! Well, we got away somehow... Was I always this slow?
Did I lose all my muscles studying for the entrance exams?"
"491","4623c49","No. There's... got to be another way."
"492","5623e3c","So we can't give up now... Gotta keep... keep on trying..."
"494","7624102","Let's go back... Go back and... figure out what to do...
together."
"505","eb9ec57d","We'll continue with our plan for the antivirus program...
Everyone, hurry with your information-gathering."
"573","6bcb4e5c","Hey! Did you find Datamon? Not that I think things will be that easy..."
