"4","43e5e912","You just need to give us commands as usual!"
"9","48e5f131","You seem really confused all of a sudden!"
"11","44e8297c","You've gotta be kidding me. You're not supposed to forget
us--your partners!"
"15","fd2db5d5","No... I have to keep going. I've finally met
{0}... And this is where I'm a goner?!"
"16","fc2db462","I see... We may be defeated here... But we won't let that
happen... to {0}!"
"18","fa2db11c","What is this... The light of a Bond?"
"19","12dbc01","I can feel the power... The Bond is transforming into power!"
"20","2dbaae","Let's go! As long as {0}'s with us..."
"23","37917545","This isn't the time to be sleeping! We must defend our
partner!"
"26","30916a40","Yes, I'm okay.
What about you?"
"35","ace26581","And two of them, no less. That's an odd relationship."
"38","b3e4af7d","Heh-heh-heh! No need to look so depressed."
"42","baf4b2cb","Just remember: As their Tamer, you have a duty to care for
them."
"53","ff188368","The power of an Ultimate is overwhelming... It appeared from
nowhere, caused massive damage, and then disappeared."
"54","fe1881f5","We were at our wits' end..."
"55","fd188002","I mobilized my knowledge and technology to build a trap, in
order to capture the Machinedramon."
"57","11647d7","The plan worked. In fact, the plan went even better than
expected."
"62","fe16431e","It would be hard to believe that it is just one lone Ultimate
Digimon doing all this damage."
"73","6f1db0e6","But why did this Tokomon Digivolve into Machinedramon?
Or at least an altered form of Machinedramon?"
"74","7a1dc217","Hmmm... We won't be able to figure it out with just this
small amount of information from this Tokomon."
"86","6e0ea489","I will look into this small amount of strange data we have
collected from this Tokomon."
"91","710ea942","So then, {0}... I'm counting on you."
"100","10dac11a","And maybe we could solve some other mysteries, too... Like
how we can send you all home."
"104","c8d4b4c9","I told you. We don't know what's going on here, so we have
to be careful."
"105","c9d4b6bc","But, but... This person looks kind!"
"115","4fd7c825","Anyway... At least tell us your name, okay?"
"117","4dd7c4df","Yukimura, you're always so formal. You said the exact same
thing when we first met."
"129","59da165a","Only two Digishroom… I want to go in farther,
but there's an aggressive Digimon in the way."
"133","59dc5531","You can't get back to the real world, even from, um, Floatia?"
"134","58dc535e","Well... If you're still here, there really must be no
way back, right?"
"137","5ddc5b7d","Well, let's see if we can get to Floatia. We can take these
Digimon too, right?"
"139","f282b5a3","{0}... That name you told us!"
"140","f182b430","What? Didn't you hear the first time?"
"142","f782bd42","I'm supposed to know this person or something?"
"149","f08073e6","And Himari had just got into high school, so she probably
wouldn't know you, either."
"151","d6a99691","Hmm. I see."
"161","daabdbb4","Yes. I have already made a promise to {0}."
"165","d6abd508","{0} has been bringing residents back to
Floatia and greatly assisting in its recovery."
"168","d3abd04f","Heh! You sound motivated, at least."
"186","6eb5a7b","But nature is in itself impermanent. I believe in becoming one
with the flow, like a twig on the river."
"199","fbe90a53","As an unclean being, you need only wait for the Enforcer
to cleanse you from this world."
"201","9e9205d","""Enforcer?"" If you've got an Enforcer, 
how come they haven't taken care of the Machinedramon already?"
"203","7be6027c","Why hasn't the Enforcer of order in this world 
taken action against the unclean Machinedramon...?"
"218","2ec99627","No... He told us just to report what happened to the seed.
And we don't know what'll happen if we pluck it."
"227","5a92abfa","Otherwise, we're going to drag you back with us if we
have to!"
"228","5b92ad6d","Huh... I really didn't want it to come to this. But I am
going to have to speak with that old fossil."
"243","5e427a39","You managed to coax the eccentric Taomon back to city for
the first time in a long while."
"246","5f427bac","Um, so... You two are... friends?"
"249","6442834b","I've completed the basic logic, and I've just about managed
to make a prototype."
"256","f33f9331","Hey! Could you knock it off?!"
"257","f03f8e78","Please stop talking about things without explaining them to us!"
"270","e73d41b6","Then the Machinedramon issue would be automatically solved."
"284","217520e7","You received a Taoistic Charm from Taomon."
"293","a773b09","Well... {0} has two partners, and defeated an
Ultimate Machinedramon. So I am curious..."
"296","bf1b4e57","I was just speaking with Taomon. 
Thanks to you, this city has really started to grow."
"297","be1b4ce4","Taomon is here now, and we really want to make the place grow even bigger."
"298","bd1b4b71","If you bring even more Digimon here, we're going to need a lot more space."
"299","bc1b499e","Plus, we're building the detector here too, so things are
getting pretty cramped."
"300","bb1b482b","I want my apprentices Meramon and Kyubimon at
Logic Volcano to come and help with the upgrades."
"301","ba1b46b8","If we all work together, it won't take so long. Maybe even
just a single day."
"303","f4fbe619","Oh! You're back, {0}!
As you can see, the city's a lot bigger now!"
"304","f1fbe140","Because of all the residents you brought in, 
we finished early. It looks like the detector will be ready soon, too."
"309","183be1f9","But... There are indications of an alien data wave that might
be caused by an altered form."
"319","9238d070","Rikka! Digivolved from Salamon to Gatomon!"
"349","edda1791","Ah! But now it's totally destroyed..."
"374","ebf556d1","But... you Digivolved..."
"375","eaf5557e","I'm sorry, Kouta..."
"378","72720c38","It was only a Child Digimon, but it turned into an Ultimate…
This must be the altered form."
"402","252e4b90","But we didn't save the village... If only we had done
a better job..."
"408","2f2e5b6e","Umm... There was this human in a knitted hat. Then it felt
like something was changing inside of me..."
"411","242c0b46","That's right! Luche said she saw a person wearing a knitted
hat, too!"
"421","3632e3a1","They were prizes for being in the top four in a Digital
Monster tournament when we were kids."
"436","293090b3","Could the shock of the Machinedramon attack have made you lose
your memory temporarily?"
"441","be3836e7","I think you're being overly optimistic. Finding Mameo
is going to be difficult."
"448","b7382be2","This is progress of a sort."
"449","ba35f1c4","So we all just have to wait until an abnormal data wave is
detected?"
"455","b835eefe","Sorry, but I'm out."
"461","2e3d6465","Heheh. I see you are comprehending the concept of going with
the flow. You're almost like a twig."
"465","35bff8b6","Are you surprised? Rikka Digivolved. But we can talk about that later."
"471","3bc001c8","OK."
"473","39c23d59","Kouta still seems upset. I think he feels responsible for what happened."
"482","42d70869","Seems like a big risk, but OK... I guess it'll make
things easier later."
"510","6bee2999","I see! So there's no way back to the real world for you."
"518","f9f5c4c8","No... I need to get home right away..."
"522","f6f5c00e","There's a curse?
You came here to the Digital World on your own?"
"524","f6f5c00c","You came here to the Digital World on your own?
What is that egg?"
"526","f6f5c00a","You came here to the Digital World on your own?"
"531","f6f38198","I thought I could do something about the curse, but..."
"535","faf387c4","Being able to use it is like a reward for saving the Digital World in the past."
"539","fae6bc31","The curse exists because I didn't defeat that man
when I had the chance..."
"541","f8e6b8eb","But I'm kind of out of my element here, and at somewhat
of a loss."
"544","fde6c08a","But setting that aside for a moment... Can you tell me what
you know about the situation?"
"547","f2e6af59","I think we've resolved a few things here, but the question
as to why the abnormalities are happening remains."
"551","f6e4772e","No! But it's serious!"
"553","f8e47a74","This is Mameo?! Wow... Tsuzuki, you've aged!"
"559","66ebe303","All I can tell you is it sounds like a false accusation. But
is now really the time? We're in a hurry."
"564","69ebe7dc","Whoa! That thing is huge!"
"575","fde8ff61","That Machinedramon... with a single blow?"
"587","7bdcf988","Sakura... Nazuna... I'm sorry..."
"644","752750b2","I've been to lots of places before! But this..."
"645","76275225","So many scared Digimon, all ""Gah!"" and ""oooh..."""
"646","73274d6c","So much scaredness and sadness..."
"655","1b73ded7","Rikka is Perfect now... Strong enough to defeat
Machinedramon... You don't have to worry about us!"
"656","78f966f","I'm going, too! Maybe it'll help me remember something."
"657","68f94fc","Staying behind is boring! I wanna go, too!"
"658","f506a4bb","I'll guard Floatia with my life! Don't you worry!"
"659","3f308d0","You have to plant a seed? I don't understand Taomon, but at
least you don't have to worry about guarding the city."
"662","f425061c","I'll do any training for Kouta!"
