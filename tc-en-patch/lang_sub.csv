but I'm having a little trouble. That's where you come in."
"70","7db6ad97","Bring me a Cheerful Apple, a Digistalk, and a Salty Fruit
whenever you can! Got all that?"
"82","8a53f564","Oh sweet! You brought all three of 'em!"
"84","8b53f6d7","Thanks a bunch! Just what I needed for my fertilizer.
Alright, time to grow some delicious meat!"
"95","5b67d268","Ta-daaah! A Recovery Disk! Just what every Tamer needs!
I can let it go now for a paltry sum of 100 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"123","e960632d","You got Recovery Disk x 1!"
"205","a5d02436","YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND? YOU ARE NOT THE 
SHARPEST KNIFE IN THE DRAWER, ARE YOU?"
"324","10717c72","The truth is, my brother Leomon is fighting a tough battle
in the Ohguino Wilderness beyond this sand wall..."
"341","157ce315","My turbines are all scorched from using my special move...
I don't think I can go on like this..."
"343","177aa784","Please, go to the Ohguino Wilderness and help Leomon for me!"
"390","37a86498","I heard whispers in the wind of you, and now I wish to
engage you in combat..."
"466","40abdb5f","Wait, am I getting ahead of myself? You got something you
wanna say to me first?"
"500","a091bc20","OmegaShoutmon joined the city!"
"503","b8b3dfd9","Give back the Myobrella you stole!
...Or maybe not."
"507","bcb3e605","It was a slip of the tongue, this one knows not of such a Digimon!
If you would doubt this one, fight and find out for yourself!"
"515","df8a9f6a","Oh, it is to protect against the harmful rays of the sun?
But Myotismon looked fine to this one... perhaps it's for fashion?"
"526","4eba4a40","This one knows nothing of items stolen by nefarious Digimon.
That matter is left to you."
"536","521a94ab","If you're gonna be Angemon's lapdog, then come at me!"
"561","9711514a","Ho ho! You think you can beat me?! I'll burn that confidence
right to the ground!"
"583","feae3ac1","The answer isn't nine! You're a clone!
The answer is nine! It IS the real you!"
"584","fbae3608","...In that case, ask one of the other ones for their question."
"592","3e7b98ec","The answer isn't nine! You're a clone!
The answer is nine! It IS the real you!"

"594","407b9c32","Splendid! You are correct!"
"595","437ba08b","All of these sayings have three in them...so when you add
them up, they equal nine!"

"612","da0264ea","Thank you, kind one! It is a race against time. I need you
to stop that rampaging Digimon..."
"615","d7026011","...but I have just awoken, and it seems that foe is somehow
preventing me from replenishing my energy."
"623","348eb39","Susanomon joined the city!"
"791","737de5f0","...Like about laying waste to the Meaty Troop Digimon and
Ohguino Wilderness? You know about all that?!"
"796","31a0690d","...Like how we'll shoot a laser using ShineGreymon's solar
power, laying waste to the Meaty Troops and Ohguino?!"
"798","55697268","The one enticing Rosemon to raze the Ohguino Wilderness so
we can develop the land afterwards...?"
"805","ca274138","Hey you! What're you doing here?!"
"806","cd2745f1","I am Leomon, the leader of the Meaty Troops of the Ohguino
Wilderness."
"818","c124f476","The truth is, us Meaty Troops and Rosemon's Veggie Troops
are clashing here in the Ohguino Wilderness..."
"826","9dd82353","We need you to understand more about the Ohguino Wilderness.
Try and get some info out of the Veggie Troops!"
"828","9183af86","You've learned what's happening in the Ohguino Wilderness!"
"851","d91bf991","That damn Rosemon! To think they plan to burn down all of
the Ohguino Wilderness with a laser!"
"855","d51bf365","The Ohguino Wilderness, and the lives of all the Digimon who
live here, are counting on you! Good luck!"
"857","1515204","The Ohguino Wilderness, and the lives of all the Digimon who
live here, are counting on you! Good luck!"
"860","e8e36a16","All of this is thanks to your hard work! The Meaty Troops...
no, all of us Digimon in the Ohguino Wilderness thank you!"
"907","9e43cb6a","AND I SHALL SOUNDLY TROUNCE YOU IF YOU ATTEMPT TO PASS!"
"912","336676ff","AND I SHALL SOUNDLY TROUNCE YOU IF YOU ATTEMPT TO PASS!"
"920","ee1c156d","Well, too late! With the energy harvested from ShineGreymon,
the laser's ready to fire on the Ohguino Wilderness!"
"921","ed1c13fa","Those savage Meaty Troops and all of the Wilderness will go
up in flames! But it's no fun in firing it right away..."
"925","e91c0d4e","Your fear has gotten the better of you, has it? Very well...
I can wait a little while longer!"
"962","79de60dd","I see... While I've been captured, such a fate has befallen
this Ohguino Wilderness..."
"968","efdb4928","My beloved Ohguino Wilderness is in danger. I wish I could
fight with you, but this body would only get in your way..."
"970","f1db4c0e","I see, you stopped them from firing the laser! Please, go
tell Leomon at once!"
"973","f7304337","But thanks to all your hard work, peace has returned to
these Ohguino Wilderness..."
"974","f4303e7e","That is why I can end my watch over the Wilderness without
worry, and heal myself with this warm light shining down..."
"981","b7f94d15","But thanks to all your hard work, peace has returned to
this Ohguino Wilderness..."
"988","5c527367","The truth is, a great pirate of the Digi-seas finally wound up
here after his last voyage!"
"989","59526eae","According to legend, the captain retired from the seas, and
lives here to this day..."
"990","5a527001","There's a super-valuable Holy Chalice hidden somewhere
around here! That's where you come in, buddy..."
"1101","7884dba4","I made you worry too, didn't I, buddy? ...my bad. Master and
apprentice will be back together in no time! Peace out!"
"1134","8d520a7f","And not any old Digimon, either. Among sea dragon types, I'm
an elite Perfect Digimon!"
"1162","fda233a8","...I won't let you do any more fishing! All right, now get
outta here!"
"1191","2f236e76","I, who fight alone, and you, who fight with two Digimon...
We do things differently, yet we seek the same strength."
"1226","b2645b61","HAGURUMON IS IN THE CONTROL ROOM OF FAULT EX MACHINA!

HAVE IT! PLEASE HURRY AND GET IT!"
"1269","a4c82221","Lately two ferocious Digimon have been fighting here in
Fault Ex Machina...rampaging anytime and any place."
"1272","a1c81d68","I've stopped them time and time again, but I had to give up
to save myself. Still, maybe you can do something to help?"
"1286","4227c273","Hey, you there! This ain't a spectator sport! Clear off if
you don't wanna get hurt!"
"1387","2257c622","Correct again! Lookit the brainiac over here! Terriermon's
single horn plus Lopmon's three horns add up to four!"
"1401","581c3dd2","Anything's okay? In that case, we'll go join the city!"
"1413","4fbd8733","Garurumon should be in the Ohguino Wilderness."
"1467","5b02dcaf","AHH-WOO-WOO-WOOOOO! You're amazing, kid! Check it

apologizing...I'll go to the city..."
"1601","e186be3f","{0}, harbinger of peace for this world!
I am known as LordKnightmon, of the Royal Knights!"
"1613","f824154a","LordKnightmon joined the city!"
"1738","311b50b0","And were a good Ultimate Digimon such as I to make contact with
this pure evil, I fear the corruption might infect me..."
"1773","99ef3764","Hmph... I imagine you're itching to go on ahead, but if you
want to pass, you'll have to defeat the Digimon before you."
"1774","9cef3c3d","I bet you're thinking, ""it's just one opponent, what's the
big deal?"" ...Surprised? I can read your mind, buddyâ€¦"
"1830","39dd2985","HMM...I HAVE NOT SEEN YOUUU BEFORE...WHY ARE YOUUU HERE?"
"1832","33dd2073","I WAS BEATEN BY A DIFFERENT HUUUMAN FROM YOUUU, 
AND WOUUUND UP HERE."
"1833","32dd1e80","MAYBE THAT HUUUMAN IS FURTHER AHEAD IN THIS AREA. YOUUU
WOULD GO TO DEFEAT THEM, WOULDN'T YOUU."
"1834","35dd2359","IN THAT CASE...YOUUU AND I HAVE THE SAME GOAL. BUT DON'T
THINK I CAN TRUST WHAT YOUUU SAY JUST LIKE THAT..."
"1835","34dd21e6","IF WHAT YOUUU SAY IS TRUE...THEN I MUUUST TEST YOUUU FIRST
IN BATTLE!"
"1846","b63063bd","I FEEL SO REFRESHED AFTER FIGHTING YOUUU! MAYBE I'LL GO AND

boom..."
"1859","53d6ebf5","I cannot use it myself.
Sorry, I have something to do."
"1866","14a0ec37","C'mon, use that Taoist charm, just a little!"
"1887","92ee0939","First, let me name myself... I am SaintGargomon..."
"1889","94ee0c1f","That Digimon is RustTyranomon! I drove him off just before he
annihilated our world... He is destruction personified..."
